Part 5 in [a series of posts](https://underwaterowlbear.github.io/tag/rangers) summarizing the history of rangers as a DnD class throughout the editions (both TSR and WOTC).

I happen to have a hard copy of the 3.5e *PHB* - so that is what I will be using as source material for this post.

## D&D 3rd Edition (3.5) - 2003

Proficient in only light armor - not medium or heavy. Proficient in all weapons. Base attack bonus as fighter. Same Fortitude save as fighter, but better Reflex save.

**Prime Requisite**: Not applicable - 3rd edition did away with prime requisites.

**Ability Score Requirements**: Not applicable - 3rd edition did away with ability score requirements.

**HD**: 1 at first level, d8 size (one step worse than fighters).

**XP**: Not applicable - 3rd edition uses a common experience point advancement chart, so members of all classes advance at the same rate.

**Spellcasting**: Can cast up to 4th level spells, starting at 6th level (or starting at 4th level, if the ranger has bonus spells per day from a high Wisdom score). Has a dedicated ranger spell list.

**Restrictions**: None.

**Benefits & Abilities**:

- Combat style: can choose either two-weapon fighting or archery. Benefits from this are given as feats.
- Tracking, presented as gaining the Tracking feat. Operates identically to 3.0e.
- Hide and Move Silently as class skills. The ranger also gains Camouflage and Hide in Plain Sight at higher levels, further improving his stealth.
- Favored enemy: +2 to track and +2 to damage against favored enemy chosen at 1st level. Also pick an additional favored enemy type and gain an additional +2 bonus to allocate every 5 levels.
- Animal Empathy as class skill. No longer exclusive to rangers. However he does gain (along with the druid) a Wild Empathy class feature.
- Special followers are not gained, but the ranger does get an Animal Companion at 4th level.

## Analysis

This ranger is made even stealthier and gains more animal-related abilities. I can see why this ranger was viewed as more similar to the rogue than the fighter in 3.5e. The loss of medium armor was not so crippling, as this ranger's combat styles only work in light armor. Favored Enemy is buffed. Overall I feel this ranger leans a little too far towards the thief / rogue than its more fighter-y origins in *AD&D*.
