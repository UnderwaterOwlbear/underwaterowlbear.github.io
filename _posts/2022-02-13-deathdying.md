Characters may bind their wounds after combat to restore 1 HP of damage sustained in that fight.  

Resting in camp for a night restores d6 HP, as long as the character has both shelter and food. Each day without food reduces max HP by 1 HP per HD. Resting in a town or similar safe location for a night restores all HP.

When a combatant reaches 0 HP, they must make a saving throw. On a failure, they die. On a success, they are merely grievously wounded -- roll on the table below to determine their injuries.
