Now that the holidays are over and we're into the new year, I'd like to pay more attention to the blog again. I have to admit, over the holidays I grew frustrated with Harrow (my in-process hack of Into the Odd), and spent much of winter break poring over the Gygaxian ramblings that are OD&D. The simplicity and hackability intrigued me, and after stumbling across Whitebox: Fantastic Medieval Adventure Game (FMAG), I was hooked.

I've started running Dyson Logos's mini-megadungeon [Dyson's Delve](https://dysonlogos.blog/maps/dysons-delve/) using a lightly houseruled Whitebox: FMAG. Paul over at Paul's Gameblog has done some great work with investigating the [inferred setting and factions](https://www.paulsgameblog.com/2018/07/12/factions-in-dysons-delve/) inside Dyson's Delve, which I'll be using to fill in the background of the delve. The house rules I'll be using are as follows:

- No Clerics. For party healing, I cribbed the 5e rest mechanic (rest, eat a ration, roll a HD to heal that many HP).
- Thieves have 1/2 HD progression (as Wizards)
- Add HD to your to-hit roll.
- HD are d6
- Light weapons deal 1d4 damage, hand weapons 1d6, two-handed 1d8
- Ascending armor class, unarmored AC 10
- [Shields shall be splintered](http://trollsmyth.blogspot.com/2008/05/shields-shall-be-splintered.html)
- Slot-based encumbrance, with a number of inventory slots equal to your Strength score
- Ability scores of 15 or higher grant +1 bonuses to various rolls. No penalties.

The two sessions so far have gone reasonably well. A hireling was burnt alive by fire beetles, and the party dwarf had his throat ripped out by a giant ferret. Though they've only recovered about 100gp so far. I've played fast and loose with movement rules and dungeon turns, instead rolling an [overloaded encounter die](http://www.necropraxis.com/2017/11/22/hazard-system-v0-3/) whenever the party moved between rooms, down a hallway, or searched a room. It seemed to work well enough.
