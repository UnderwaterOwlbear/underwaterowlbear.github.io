## Spellbooks

Spellbooks contain a single spell. Anyone can cast a spell by holding a Spellbook in both hands and reading its contents aloud. Casting a spell adds one (1) **fatigue**. If they are in danger, a **WIL** save may be required to avoid terrible consequences. Some spells allow multiple levels of **fatigue** to be taken to enhance their effect.

**Scrolls** are similar to Spellbooks, however:

* They do not cause **fatigue**, nor can additional **fatigue** be taken to enhance their effect.
* They disappear after one use.

## Casting

Unless otherwise specified, spells take 1 action to cast. Spells cannot be cast when **encumbered**.  

### Duration

Unless otherwise specified, spell effects last for 10 minutes per **fatigue** taken.  

### Casting Interruptions

A spellcaster who is in melee range of an enemy while casting a spell must make a **WIL** saving throw. If he fails, no effect takes place.

## Spell Descriptions

### Animate Dead

Animate a number of undead equal to **fatigue** taken (have d6 **HP** each). Roll d6 when spell ends: (1-3) undead become hostile, (4-5) undead collapse into dust, (6) undead serve the caster permanently.

### Augury

Perform a divination to determine whether a given course of action will result in "weal" or "woe". The caster may ask one question per level. DM rolls a d6 secretly: on a 4+, the answer is truthful. Sacrifice 1d6 **STR** in blood to guarantee a truthful answer.

### Bless
