Inspired by [this thread](https://bsky.app/profile/underwaterowlbear.bsky.social/post/3khisnyg2gh2n) on Bluesky over the weekend.This is assuming you are using side-based initiative like *Into the Odd*.

## Decisive Encumbrance

Characters can choose how encumbered they are, and what they are encumbered with, from the following options:

1. **Unencumbered** - The character is only carrying their fighting kit (weapons, armor, spellbook, holy symbol, thieves tools, etc) and a few personal trinkets (magic rings, treasure map, anything that can be stuffed into a pocket).
    - **Benefits:** Always act before monsters (don't need to make a **DEX** save).
    - **Drawbacks:** Not carrying any supplies for wilderness travel, or treasure for leveling up.
2. **Encumbered with Supplies** - The character is carrying their fighting kit, trinkets, and a backpack full of supplies (rations, waterskins, torches, iron spikes, rope, etc).
    - **Benefits:** Can carry 2 weeks of supplies for wilderness travel, and gains +1 on miscellaneous dungeon exploration *X-in-6* rolls (including open doors, pick lock, hear noises, etc, but excluding surprise and initiative).
    - **Drawbacks:** Must succeed on a **DEX** saving throw to act before monsters.
3. **Encumbered with Treasure** - The character is carrying their fighting kit, trinkets, and a backpack full of treasure (gold coins, gemstones, jewelry, statuettes, etc).
    - **Benefits:** Can trade the treasure for 2d6x100 XP in town.
    - **Drawbacks:** Must succeed on a **DEX** saving throw to act before monsters.
