Part 2 in [a series of posts](https://underwaterowlbear.github.io/tag/rangers) summarizing the history of rangers as a DnD class throughout the editions (both TSR and WOTC).

## AD&D 1st Edition - 1977

They are again referred to as a "sub-class of fighter".

**Prime Requisite**: Strength, Intelligence, and Wisdom (15+ in all gives 110% XP accrual rate).

**Ability Score Requirements**: STR 13+, WIS 14+, CON 14+

**HD**: 2 at first level, d8 size. *AD&D* fighters have d10 HD, for comparison.

**XP**: 2250 XP to reach 2nd level, 113% of that required for fighters.

**Spellcasting**: As both Druid (starting at 8th level) and Magic-User (starting at 9th level) only casting up to 3rd level spells.

**Restrictions**:

- Only own what they can carry. Donate excess treasure or goods to a worthy cause.
- No followers or hirelings until 8th level.
- Only three may operate together.
- Must be Good in alignment. If the ranger ever becomes Neutral or Evil, he loses the benefits of this class and becomes a normal fighter with d8 HD.

**Benefits & Abilities**:

- Tracking. Track monsters at a 25-65% chance depending on dungeon features, and 90% in the outdoors with -10% per day old the trail is.
- Surprised only on 1-in-6 instead of 2-in-6. Surprise enemies on 3-in-6 instead of 2-in-6.
- Favored enemy: +1 damage per level to "giant class" creatures.
- At 9th level, create a stronghold as a fighter of the same level.
- At 10th level, gain 2-24 (2d12) "special followers" determined by the DM. When killed, they cannot be replaced.
- At 10th level, gain the ability to use scrying magic items.

The *AD&D* ranger gains multiple attacks at a slightly slower rate than a fighter (1-2 levels behind).

"Giant class" creatures are specifically noted as:

- bugbears
- ettins
- giants
- gnolls
- goblins
- hobgoblins
- kobolds
- ogres
- ogre magi
- orcs
- trolls

## Analysis

This version of the ranger is *extremely* similar to Joe Fischer's *OD&D* version. Most abilities happen at the same or nearly the same level. Cleric spellcasting is traded for druid spellcasting. The special class ability granting faster XP accrual is trashed in favor of prime requisites like that of all other *AD&D* classes, and XP requirements are lowered somewhat. HD are reduced to d8 but keep the 2 HD at 1st level. Restrictions remain broadly similar, though the group limit is increased from two to three and "Lawful / Chaotic" replaced with "Good / Evil" as the primary alignment axis of interest. 

All in all a modest evolution of the class, with most changes intended to bring it into line with other *AD&D* class mechanics and conventions.
