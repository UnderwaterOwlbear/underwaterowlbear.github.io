Thinking about this article: [https://profaneape.com/2022/02/17/3-swords/](https://profaneape.com/2022/02/17/3-swords/) and how to differentiate weaponry in a *Cairn*-like system. Can we use the  [metals of antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metals_of_antiquity) to add some texture to weapon types?

- Gold
- Silver
- Iron
- Copper (used in bronze)
- Tin (used in bronze)
- Quicksilver
- Lead

## Weapons

### Bronze

Bronze weapons are the default. Made from a mixture of copper and tin, often formed by casting into molds.

**Damage**: d6 / d8  
**Cost**: 1x  
**Can be used in**: Any weapons  
**Special**: None  

---

### Cold Iron

Wrought from meteoric iron that has never felt the heat of a forge, weapons made from cold iron are especially baneful to fey.

**Damage**: d6 / d8  
**Cost**: 2x  
**Can be used in**: Any weapons  
**Special**: Fey who are struck by cold iron have *disadvantage* on saves to avoid critical damage.

---

### Steel

Forged from iron in a bed of red-hot charcoal, steel weapons are sharper than their cold iron counterparts, but lose any baneful qualities. Any smith with the knowledge and skill to forge steel weapons will, of course, make swords or other edged weapons only. Steel is wasted on crude clubs and maces.

**Damage**: d8 / d10  
**Cost**: 5x  
**Can be used in**: Edged weapons  
**Special**: None  

---

### Silvered

Silver-inlaid weapons are able to harm even spectres and wraiths as though they were made of flesh and blood.

**Damage**: d6 / d8  
**Cost**: 10x  
**Can be used in**: Any weapons  
**Special**: Can harm incorporeal undead.  

---

### Gilded

Gilt weapons are used by kings and emissaries as emblems of their wealth and authority.

**Damage**: d6 / d8  
**Cost**: 20x  
**Can be used in**: Any weapons  
**Special**: +2 on reaction rolls  

---

### Channeled

Executioner's swords contain hidden paths inside the blade connected to a reservoir of quicksilver in the pommel. When swung, the extra momentum gained from the transfer of weight into the blade can cause truly fearsome wounds.

**Damage**: d10  
**Cost**: 20x  
**Can be used in**: Two-handed weapons  
**Special**: *Enhance* damage against enemies with <6 HP.  

## Shields

### Wooden

Made from linden, pine, fir, spruce, or other soft wood that does not split easily.

**Armor**: +1  
**Cost**: 1x  
**Special**: None

---

### Brazen

Large bronze shields are favored by the pikemen of some city-states. They are unwieldy, but provide unparalleled protection.

**Armor**: +2  
**Cost**: 3x  
**Special**: Encumbrance as *bulky*

---

### Leaden

Lead-lined shields have been found to be curiously effective at repelling sorcerous onslaughts.

**Armor**: +1  
**Cost**: 5x  
**Special**: *Advantage* on saves vs. magic, *sunder* to automatically save. Encumbrance as bulky  

---

### Mirrored

Sheathed in polished silver, these shields are prized by some questing heroes for use against medusae, basilisks, cockatrices, or other baleful gazes.

**Armor**: +1  
**Cost**: 10x  
**Special**: *Advantage* on saves vs. gaze attacks, *sunder* to automatically save.
