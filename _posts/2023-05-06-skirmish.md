Sometimes I feel the warband mechanics for *Cairn*, *Into the Odd*, and similar games leave something to be desired. So I whipped up these skirmish wargame rules designed for a certain range of 28mm-tall grimdark gothic future miniatures.

**Starting Stats**: 4 HP, 10 STR, 10 DEX, 10 WIL, 6" MV

**Saves**: Roll d20 *under* a stat to save.

- STR for dying, poisons, resisting movement
- DEX for terrain and initiative (activate models from highest DEX to lowest)
- WIL for morale and psychic

**Actions**: take 2 in a turn

- Move up to your **MV** stat
- Attack with your weapon
- Interact with something

**Attacks**: Roll your weapon's damage die, and subtract any Armor that your target possesses. You deal that much damage to your target's **HP**.

**Damage** that reduces a target’s **HP** below zero decreases a target’s **STR** by the amount remaining. They must then make a **STR** save to avoid death.

| Carbine   | d6     | 12"   | bulky                       |
| Energy    | d6     | 6"    | bulky, ignore Armor         |
| Shotgun   | d8     | 6"    | bulky                       |
