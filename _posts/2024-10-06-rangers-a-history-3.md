Part 3 in [a series of posts](https://underwaterowlbear.github.io/tag/rangers) summarizing the history of rangers as a DnD class throughout the editions (both TSR and WOTC).

## AD&D 2nd Edition - 1989

They are categorized as a member of the "warrior" group of classes, alongside fighters and paladins. All three classes share a d10 HD and are allowed to use any weapon or armor.

**Prime Requisite**: Strength, Dexterity, and Wisdom (16+ in all gives 110% XP accrual rate).

**Ability Score Requirements**: STR 13+, DEX 13+, CON 14+, WIS 14+

**HD**: 1 at first level, d10 size (the same as fighters).

**XP**: 2250 XP to reach 2nd level, 113% of that required for fighters.

**Spellcasting**: As a class of the "priest" group, but only spells from the "plant" or "animal" spheres, starting at 8th level.

**Restrictions**:

- Only own what they can carry. Donate excess treasure or goods to a worthy cause.
- No followers or hirelings until 8th level.
- Must be Good in alignment. If the ranger ever becomes Neutral or Evil, he loses the benefits of this class and becomes a normal fighter with d10 HD. This is reversible with penance.

**Benefits & Abilities**:

- Two-weapon fighting without penalty (if wearing light armor).
- Tracking, and +1 bonus to tracking every 3 levels. This is now part of 2e's "proficiency" system.
- "Move silently" and "hide in shadows" starting at 10% and 15%, respectively, and gaining 5-8% per level. Only works in light armor. This is about the same as a thief, though a thief who chooses to specialize in the above skills can quickly outstrip a ranger of the same level in stealth. Note a ranger's chance of succeeding on these is halved in non-natural settings.
- Favored enemy: +4 to hit against a chosen species of enemy, and -4 to reaction rolls with it.
- Animal Empathy - a variety of skills at interacting with and calming animals.
- At 10th level, gain 2-12 (2d6) "special followers". These are most likely men, elves, animals, or rangers. But occasionally ~~hobbits~~ halflings or extraordinary wilderness creatures.

## Analysis

Changes to the surprise mechanics are replaced with "move silently" and "hide in shadows", as the thief skills. The Aragorn-like ability to use scrying items disappears. The two- or three-ranger restriction disappears. Animal empathy, stealth, two-weapon fighting, and a player-selected favored enemy appear (which will carry forward into future editions). Note that *AD&D* 2nd edition was published in 1989, a year after *The Crystal Shard* was published (where the twin-scimitar-wielding, panther-accompanied, drow ranger Drizzt Do-Urden makes his first appearance). This may have resulted in the inclusion of dual wielding and animal companions ("great cat" is an option in the 10th level special followers list). Though, Drizzt's companion Guenhwyvar was not a true "animal companion" in the 3rd Edition sense of the word. She was summoned from the Astral Plane by a *figurine of wondrous power* - a magic item that first appeared in *AD&D* 1st edition.
