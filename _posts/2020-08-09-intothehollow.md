I've submitted my entry to the [Eclectic Bastion Jam](https://itch.io/jam/eclectic-bastion-jam) - Into the Hollow. A rules-light hack of Into the Odd, Into the Hollow lets you and a GM recreate the Soulslike combat of Hollow Knight on the tabletop. Check it out on the jam page or on my storefront below.
