3. **Play more.** Have at least 2 play sessions of each of these games:
    - [Grimdark Future: Firefight](https://www.onepagerules.com/games/grimdark-future-firefight) by OnePageRules. I've found a local group of friends who play this already, so it's pretty low-friction to get a game together.
    - ✅[TONKs](https://28magcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/tonks.pdf): completed
    - [My house rules for Cairn](https://underwaterowlbear.github.io/pages/rules.html). I've been tinkering with these for years, and need to just bite the bullet and try running a game for a handful of friends in town.
4. 🚧**Visit grandparents.** Make at least 4 visits to each of my pairs of grandparents in 2024.
    - My paternal grandparents: 1 visit
    - My maternal grandparents: 1 visit
    - Wife's paternal grandparents: no visits
    - Wife's maternal grandparents: 1 visit
5. 🚫**Scroll less.** Already failed this one and reinstalled Instagram.
