Part 4 in [a series of posts](https://underwaterowlbear.github.io/tag/rangers) summarizing the history of rangers as a DnD class throughout the editions (both TSR and WOTC).

Note that the source text for this post is *Before the Empire, the 3.0 SRD* by [Wandering Star, LLC](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/423878/before-the-empire-the-3-0-srd) on DriveThru, and / or [pawsplay](https://pawsplay.itch.io/before-the-empire-the-30-srd) on itch.io.

## D&D 3rd Edition (3.0) - 2000

Proficiencies, saving throws, and base attack bonus are as fighters (with the exception of being unable to wear heavy armor).

**Prime Requisite**: Not applicable - 3rd edition did away with prime requisites.

**Ability Score Requirements**: Not applicable - 3rd edition did away with ability score requirements.

**HD**: 1 at first level, d10 size (the same as fighters).

**XP**: Not applicable - 3rd edition uses a common experience point advancement chart, so members of all classes advance at the same rate.

**Spellcasting**: Can cast up to 4th level spells, starting at 6th level (or starting at 4th level, if the ranger has bonus spells per day from a high Wisdom score). Has a dedicated ranger spell list.

**Restrictions**: None.

**Benefits & Abilities**:

- Two-weapon fighting without penalty (if wearing light armor). Presented as gaining the Ambidexterity and Two-Weapon Fighting feats.
- Tracking, presented as gaining the Tracking feat. This tracking system is much more detailed, using the Wilderness Lore skill and with varying DCs depending on time passed, terrain, size of group, and weather. It appears to be generally more difficult than the *AD&D* ranger's flat 95% chance of success.
- "Move silently" and "hide in shadows" are not explicitly given any extra abilities, but the ranger can choose Hide and Move Silently as class skills. They are about as stealthy as a rogue in this edition.
- Favored enemy: +1 to track and +1 to damage against favored enemy per 5 levels. Also pick an additional favored enemy type every 5 levels.
- Animal Empathy as an explicit ability is lost, and is now an exclusive class skill available to be picked (in the same vein as a rogue's Decipher Script skill or a wizard's Scry skill).
- Special followers are not gained.

## Analysis

More class abilities are folded into the skill subsystem (Hide, Move Silently, Track, Animal Empathy). Note that the ~~thief~~ rogue got this treatment in 3rd edition as well, with even thief abilities like Use Magic Device getting absorbed into the skill point subsystem. Favored enemy is weakened but multiple enemies are able to be chosen. Two-weapon fighting proficiency is continued. Special followers are lost. I feel this version of the ranger is least distinctive - very nearly a survival-flavored fighter, if not for the spellcasting abilities. It certainly seems less thematic than the previous, TSR-era ranger classes.
