Figured I'd follow the trend and do a retrospective post for the year. This is also a good place to document my 2024 New Year's Resolutions to refer to later.

## Retrospective - Hobby

I wrote six posts in 2023:

1. [Decisive Encumbrance](https://underwaterowlbear.github.io/2023/12/28/decisive-encumbrance.html)
2. [The Portable Wargame House Rules](https://underwaterowlbear.github.io/2023/07/23/portable-wargame-house-rules.html)
3. [Classic Traveller Skills, Part 1](https://underwaterowlbear.github.io/2023/06/19/traveller-skills-1.html)
4. [Grievous Wounds for Cairn](https://underwaterowlbear.github.io/2023/05/14/grievous-wounds.html)
5. [Vanilla Spells for Cairn](https://underwaterowlbear.github.io/2023/05/14/cairn-spells.html)
6. [Skirmish Wargame Rules for Cairn](https://underwaterowlbear.github.io/2023/05/06/skirmish.html)

Four of these were related to *Cairn* or *Into the Odd* style rules. One was about wargaming (shout-out to Bob Cordery's excellent blog, [Wargaming Miscellany](http://wargamingmiscellany.blogspot.com/)), and one was about *Classic Traveller*.[^1] I did most blogging in the first half of the year, then tapered off after July. This is mainly due to some work projects picking up in that time (July through September). Then the holiday season hit, and, well, we know how that goes.

I hope to change that in 2024. I am setting a goal of **18 blog posts in 2024**. This is a big increase, but works out to 1.5 posts per month which I think is manageable (especially if I write a few posts in one sitting, then schedule them to be posted in the future)[^2].

I also got a *carrd.co* site set up! [https://underwaterowlbear.carrd.co/](https://underwaterowlbear.carrd.co/). This serves as a nice home for my TTRPG related activities and was pretty easy to put together.

## Retrospective - Home

My wife and I celebrated our 4th wedding anniversary. We took a day trip to Chicago to see Cirque du Soleil's [*'Twas the Night Before...*](https://www.cirquedusoleil.com/twas-the-night-before) Christmas show. I reconnected with a few old friends, lost touch with a few more, and had some very dear friends visit from out of state (hi Lindsey and Katie). My grandma was diagnosed with [vascular dementia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vascular-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20378793) and there is discussion of both her and my grandpa moving in with my mom. Renovations and moving will be forthcoming... My grandpa is as independent as they come (he's in his 80s and still does his taxes - with itemized deductibles - himself by hand) but even he is on board with moving. So I think we may actually see some movement on this front in 2024.

## Retrospective - Work

(Why not, this is my blog, so I can talk about whatever I want - even work).

I had two major things happen at work this year. Firstly, I led the design, development, and launch of a new production line (I'm a manufacturing engineer). This was a challenge - I wasn't sure I would be successful at the outset of the project. But it went well, and (if I can brag) was actually regarded as one of the more successful line launches in the plant. Completing this was a big boost to my professional confidence and taught me a lot of new skills. Secondly, I accepted a new position as a manufacturing engineering supervisor. This role will have me focusing more on training and facilitating a team of other engineers, particularly two brand new engineers joining the team in 2024. It will be a change, because I'm used to working on projects directly. But I have a good manager who helps keep me from getting too into the weeds with things.

## Resolutions for 2024

I took some leadership training this year for work that taught me about [S.M.A.R.T. Goals](https://community.mis.temple.edu/mis0855002fall2015/files/2015/10/S.M.A.R.T-Way-Management-Review.pdf). So, I will try to assign measurable targets to each of my New Year's Resolutions.

1. **Write more.** Make at least 18 blog posts in 2024.
2. **Read more.** Read these books in 2024:
    1. *Absolution Gap* by Alastair Reynolds
    2. *Three Hearts and Three Lions* by Poul Anderson
    3. *A Fire Upon the Deep* by Vernor Vinge
    4. *Death's End* by Liu Cixin
    5. *A History of Civilizations* by Fernand Braudel
    6. *Skunk Works* by Ben. R. Rich
    7. *Command and Control* by Eric Schlosser
    8. *Eon* by Greg Bear
    9. *A Cruel Wind: A Chronicle of the Dread Empire* by Glen Cook
    10. *Quarantine* by Greg Egan
    11. *Destiny's Road* by Larry Niven
    12. *Dome* by Michael Reeves and Steve Perry
3. **Play more.** Have at least 2 play sessions of each of these games:
    - [Grimdark Future: Firefight](https://www.onepagerules.com/games/grimdark-future-firefight) by OnePageRules. I've found a local group of friends who play this already, so it's pretty low-friction to get a game together.
    - [TONKs](https://28magcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/tonks.pdf) using a few 1/72-scale WW2-era tanks I've scrounged from eBay.
    - [My house rules for Cairn](https://underwaterowlbear.github.io/pages/rules.html). I've been tinkering with these for years, and need to just bite the bullet and try running a game for a handful of friends in town.
4. **Visit grandparents.** Make at least 4 visits to each of my pairs of grandparents in 2024.
5. **Scroll less.** I've uninstalled the usual social media suspects from my phone: Reddit, Instagram, etc. **Do not reinstall them in 2024**. Bluesky has a stay of execution for now, as I've actually had meaningful conversations with other TTRPG hobbyists on there and it's not just mindless doom scrolling.

## Footnotes
