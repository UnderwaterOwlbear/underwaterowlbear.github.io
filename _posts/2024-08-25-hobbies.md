title: Too Many Hobbies

I occasionally think I have too many hobbies or take on too many projects. Going to try writing down everything that I'm working on or interested in to help keep track and prioritize.

## TTRPG / Wargaming / Worldbuilding

* Run a *Cairn* game using [my house rules](https://underwaterowlbear.github.io/pages/cairn.html)
* Write some ancients operational-level wargame rules (started on this with [these](https://underwaterowlbear.github.io/2024/08/01/acoup-generalship.html) [posts](https://underwaterowlbear.github.io/2024/08/02/acoup-logistics.html))
* I have an open invitation to play some *Flames of War* with a friend in town that I need to take advantage of. Probably also play some *Grimdark Future*.
* I ran across another OSR TTRPG creator in town who has an online presence. Need to meet up with them...
* There are two major worldbuilding projects that have been rattling around my head for many years that may need to finally be put to paper:
  * A "French vanilla" DnD setting that has most of the usual "fantastic medieval adventure game" tropes. Dwarves, pig-faced orcs, elves that ride dragons *a la* Moorcock and Erikson, wizards, etc.
  * Post-post-apocalyptic dying earth setting with strong *Monster Blood Tattoo* and *Book of the New Sun* vibes. Set in a devastated North America.

## Miniature Modeling

* Got really into [Trench Crusade](https://www.trenchcrusade.com/). I want to make a WW1-inspired trench gameboard - though this one feels a little ambitious. I have some WW1 British Infantry from Wargames Atlantic to make grungy trench crusaders to fight on it.
* Still have a box of Agincourt Knights and British Napoleonics to kitbash together into some [Turnip28](https://www.patreon.com/Turnip28) infantry.
* Have a batch of WH40k Chaos Cultists that need painting finished.
* WH40k inquisitorial retinue that is primed and ready for paint.
* Gaslands cars that are primed and ready for paint.

## Electronics / Computers

* A while ago I got a [Miyoo Mini](https://www.reddit.com/r/MiyooMini/) up and running with custom OnionOS firmware and a whole batch of ROMs. Haven't played it much though. Similarly, I have a Flipper Zero that I haven't done much with other than turn into a garage door opener. I have a weakness for small computer-like devices. I desperately want a [Cardputer](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/m5stack-cardputer-kit-w-m5stamps3), [UConsole](https://www.clockworkpi.com/uconsole), or [DevTerm](https://www.clockworkpi.com/home-devterm), but can't justify them with any projects or use cases.
* I recently finished making a P25 scanner for Michigan's public safety trunked radio system using [RTL-SDR](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/) dongles. I'd also like to make an ADS-B station using a RPi Zero W that pushes data to FlightAware

## Printing / Bookbinding

Earlier this year, I picked up a "pro-sumer" grade guillotine paper cutter off Craigslist. I want to use it to make zines, etc. For even more analog offline goodness, I could use the typewriter that I got from my brother's friend's restoration business to make some handmade zines that have never touched a computer. Hmm. My assortment of fountain pens, Japanese manga nibs, India Ink, etc would be cool to incorporate as well. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/1ebu1wr/painted_hexes/) on /r/OSR made me want to try watercolors.

## Bladesmithing

Friend at work has a forge and treated me with multiple weekends of working on two blades, one for me and one for my wife. Open projects remaining are:

* Finish scabbard for wife's dagger. Some leatherwork and soldering.
* Redo leather sheath for my seax / bowie knife (first attempt was functional, but oversized)
