I wanted to take a look at the Great Wheel cosmology's Outer Planes, and rework them slightly to fit my more sword-and-sorcery preferences. Here are the planes as they stand in 3.5e.

| Plane       | Alignment | Full Name                              | Theme                              | Origin                                                                                                                                                                                        |

When looking at the Great Wheel cosmology, there are a few consistent origins for plane names and themes:

* John Milton's [Paradise Lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost)
* Dante's [Inferno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante))
* Greek mythology

## Nine Circles of Hell

Baator is an invented name from the DnD franchise. The levels of Baator are mostly drawn from real sources:

1. [**Avernus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avernus): from the Greek entrance to the underworld, or the underworld itself.
2. [**Dis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dis_(Divine_Comedy)): from the fortified city of hell in Dante's *Divine Comedy*, where the unpardonable sinners are punished.
3. **Minauros**: possibly a corruption of the name *Minos*, the judge of hell seen in the [second circle of hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_circle_of_hell) in Dante's *Divine Comedy* (who himself is the same [Minos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minos) seen in the myth of Theseus).
4. **Phlegethos**: from the Greek [*Phlegethon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlegethon), a river of fire in the underworld.
5. **Stygia**: from the Greek [*Styx*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styx), another river in the underworld.
6. [**Malbolge**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malebolge): from the cavern where sinners who committed fraud were punished in Dante's *Divine Comedy*.
7. **Maladomini**: No idea on this one
8. **Cania**: No idea on this one
9. [**Nessus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nessus_(mythology)#In_popular_culture): this name originates in Greek mythology and is the name of a centaur, whose blood was poisoned by an arrow laced with hydra venom. However, Gygax probably got the name from the centaur's appearance in Dante's [*Inferno*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)#Seventh_Circle_(Violence)) (drink!). My headcanon, however, is that this circle of hell resembles the eponymous city in Gene Wolfe's *Book of the New Sun*.

## My Great Wheel

I think this list can be simplified, made to comply with the OGL, and expanded with some other free-use planes.

* Gehenna and Baator can be combined into one "hellish" fire-and-brimstone plane.  
* Ysgard and Acheron can be combined into one "battle" plane
* Limbo and the Abyss can be combined into one "primordial chaos" plane
* Arborea, the Beastlands, and Elysium can be combined into one "wilderness" plane
* Carceri and Hades can be combined into one "death / prison" plane
* Mechanus, Bytopia, Arcadia, and Celestia can be combined into one "heavenly / order" plane
* Pandemonium can stay as a "madness" plane.
* The Outlands will be removed, since they mostly facilitated the Planescape setting (which isn't the tone I'm going for).
* Should probably keep some transitional planes:
    * Ethereal
    * Astral?
    * Shadowlands?

That leaves us with this cosmology:

* Hell - Hell - Contemporary evangelical christian depictions of Hell, rampant capitalism. Peter Stormare in *Constantine*. [*The City of Dis*](http://throneofsalt.blogspot.com/2020/05/the-war-of-bull-and-sable-maid.html) from *Mother Stole Fire*
* Battle - Valhalla - Mostly just like Vahalla. Fields of battle, warriors resurrected every night, etc. *Edge of Tomorrow* but everyone knows it's a time loop. 
* Chaos - Chaos - The primordial void (outer space?). Chaos the (agender) deity from Supergiant Games' [*Hades*](https://hades.fandom.com/wiki/Chaos) 
* Wilderness - Faerie - The [Elfhame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairyland) of Celtic mythology. Arthurian. 
* Death - The Underworld - Dusty bookshelves. Quiet. Death as a stern yet kind librarian. Maybe Valhalla is a location in the underworld? Their house parties annoy the librarian.
* Madness - Carcosa - Geoffrey McKinney's [*Supplement V: Carcosa*](https://the-eye.eu/public/Books/rpg.rem.uz/Dungeons%20%26%20Dragons/Original%20D%26D/Supplement%205%20-%20Carcosa.pdf)

Such was that happy garden-state,
While man there walked without a mate:
After a place so pure and sweet,
What other help could yet be meet!
But 'twas beyond a mortal's share
To wander solitary there:
Two paradises 'twere in one
To live in Paradise alone.
