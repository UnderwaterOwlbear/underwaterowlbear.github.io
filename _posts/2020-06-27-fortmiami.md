The last few months, in the midst of COVID-19, the new civil rights movement, and me personally returning to work, I haven't posted much. But I had been reading and mulling over two rulesets: [The Landshut Rules](http://darkwormcolt.blogspot.com/p/landshut-rules.html) by Darkworm Colt AKA Norbert Matausch, and [One Page Rules](https://onepagerules.com/) by Gaetano Ferrara. The Landshut Rules are minimalist "ancient-school" rules in the spirit of Chainmail and Blackmoor, with wargaming roots.  One Page Rules are a (successful) attempt to consolidate Warhammer and Warhammer: 40k wargaming rules into one page of rules text.

I quite like what Ferrara has done with his lightweight wargaming rules (for an even lighter version, check out Chris McDowall's [GRIMLITE](http://www.bastionland.com/2020/05/grimlite.html) hack), and they made me think about what it would look like if I started with OPR as a base instead of Chainmail, but built on them in the same direction as Landshut.

So, BEHOLD! [The Fort Miami Rules](https://underwaterowlbear.itch.io/the-fort-miami-rules). It features:

- Baked-in mass combat, where player characters fight with the strength of multiple men (like Heroes in Chainmail and OPR).
- A GLOG-inspired freeform magic system
- A one-axis class system, where you can be anywhere on the scale between Hero and Sorcerer (like the Hero and Magic-User of Chainmail, but with added gradiation).
- A freeform skill and task resolution system inspired by M.A.R. Barker's "Perfected" system and married with Vincent Baker's Apocalypse World degrees of success.

Yes that sounds like a lot bolted together, but I think it flows well. This is geared less towards dungeon crawling, and more towards early domain-level play where the players are controlling small bands of followers. A good fit might be Viking warbands raiding the British coast, Robin Hood and his band of thieves waylaying caravans, or small units of Prussian infantry dealing with a zombie outbreak.

(Edit: I had a slight fiasco with setting up itch.io, and uploaded the game under the wrong account. I have since re-uploaded to my correct itch.io account and updated the link above).
