Rangers are, by far, my favorite DnD class (and I will fight to the death to categorize them as fighter-types instead of thief-types). In [a series of posts](https://underwaterowlbear.github.io/tag/rangers), I will set out to summarize the history of rangers as a DnD class throughout the editions (both TSR and WOTC) and compare the common rules elements and themes that they share.

## OD&D - The Strategic Review, Vol. 1, No. 2, Summer 1975

It's not surprising to me that Tolkienesque rangers are a strong enough archetype that nerds immediately started mailing in to TSR with their own overpowered homebrews for *OD&D*. This class was submitted to the *TSR* newsletter by Joe Fischer.

They are explicitly called out as a "sub-class of Fighting Men", which I assume means they inherit that class's weapon and armor proficiencies.

**Prime Requisite**: Strength (same as fighters)

**Ability Score Requirements**: INT 12+, WIS 12+, CON 15+

**HD**: 2 at first level, either using "the standard system" (d6), or "the alternate system which allows fighters 8-sided dice" (introduced in *Supplement 1: Greyhawk* in March 1975).

**XP**: 2500 XP to reach 2nd level, 125% of that required for fighters.

**Spellcasting**: As both Cleric (starting at 9th level) and Magic-User (starting at 10th level) up to casting as a 3rd level Cleric or MU and only casting up to 3rd level spells.

**Restrictions**:

- Only own what they can carry. Donate excess treasure or goods to a worthy cause.
- No followers or hirelings.
- Only two may operate together.
- Do not gain XP accrual bonuses for high abilities.
- Must be Lawful in alignment. If the ranger ever becomes Neutral or Chaotic, he loses the benefits of this class and becomes a normal Fighting Man.

**Benefits & Abilities**:

- For levels 1st through 7th, gain 4 XP for every 3 XP earned, or a 133% accrual rate. This is lost upon reaching 8th level. Note that at early levels this cancels out the increased XP leveling requirements above.
- Tracking. Track monsters at a 30-65% chance depending on dungeon features, and 90% in the outdoors with -10% per day old the trail is.
- Surprised only on 1-in-6 instead of 2-in-6.
- Favored enemy: +1 damage per level to "giant-type" creatures.
- At 9th level, create a stronghold as a Fighting Man of the same level.
- At 9th level, gain 2-24 (2d12) "special followers". These are most likely men, elves, or dwarves. But occasionally hobbits, and rarely rangers or extraordinary wilderness creatures. When killed, they cannot be replaced.
- At 10th level, gain the ability to use scrying magic items (a reference to Aragorn using a *palantir* in *LotR*).

It is unclear if a ranger gains the *OD&D* fighter's multiple attacks or blindsense at 8th level.

> 📝 Note: what are "giant-type" creatures, you ask? Refer to page 18 of *OD&D Vol. 3 - The Underworld & Wilderness Adventures* which has this random encounter table:

## Analysis

The *OD&D* ranger is essentially a homebrew, OP, Aragorn-as-class. It provides many of the familiar abilities and features that we see ascribed to rangers in later editions such as tracking, favored enemy, and being accompanied by wilderness creatures.
