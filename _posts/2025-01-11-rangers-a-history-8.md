Part 8 in [a series of posts](https://underwaterowlbear.github.io/tag/rangers) summarizing the history of rangers as a DnD class throughout the editions (both TSR and WOTC). 

The ranger class characteristics across the various editions are summarized in the table below. 4e has been skipped because it, as an edition, is so wildly different to the mainline *TSR* and *WotC* offerings that I feel it would not be an apples-to-apples comparison.

| Edition            | OD&D                                       | AD&D 1st                                       | AD&D 2nd                             | 3.0e                                       | 3.5e                                       | 5e (2014)                                         | 5e (2024)                                                 |

## Analysis

Consistent features of the ranger across all editions:

- Fighter-ish HD
- Spellcasting
- Favored enemy that usually grants a damage bonus
- Tracking ability
- Stealth / Surprise ability

Features present in TSR-era D&D (that are not also shared with other classes from that era, like the mere fact that they have a prime requisite):

- Can wear heavy armor
- Has class restrictions (property, followers, alignment, group size)
- Spellcasting starts late in class and only grants low-level spells
- Favored enemy preset to "giant types" (orcs, goblins, and the like)
- Special followers at higher levels
- Use of scrying magic items

Features present in WotC-era D&D:

- Lose access to heavy armor
- No restrictions
- Spellcasting starts earlier and grants higher level spells
- Favored enemy type is player-chosen
- Animal Empathy and an Animal Companion
- Fighting styles, particularly two-weapon fighting and archery

If I were to make my own version of the ranger for an OD&D-like rule set, I would probably indlude the following:

- HD as fighter
- Spellcasting as wizard, but at 1/2 or 1/3 ability. Making the class more similar to Witchers such as Geralt of Rivia.
- Favored enemy with damage bonus. But selectable with some small amount of preparation, to represent researching the habits and weaknesses of a given type of monster. Can only gain an advantage against one type at a time, however.
- Tracking ability.
- Stealth / surprise ability.
- No heavy armor.
- No class restrictions. This requires player buy-in to be effective so I'd rather not attempt to codify it.
- No special followers, no animal companions. But a ranger can still recruit hirelings.
- No animal companions. 
- No fighting styles.
- No scrying abilities.
