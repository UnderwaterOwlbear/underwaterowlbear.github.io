Inspired by [this post](https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2022/04/the-best-case-scenario-micro-wargame.html) on Numbers Aren't Real and all the [Ground Branch](https://store.steampowered.com/app/16900/GROUND_BRANCH/) I've been playing with my brother.

Alternating activations.

Operators have 2 HP,

Basic shoot mechanic: roll dice, check result.

- 6+ is a hit
- 4 or 5 is pinned
- 1, 2, or 3 is no effect

Remove number of dice rolled from ammo.  
If **pinned**, can't move.  
If in **cover**, **hit** results count as **pinned** instead.  

Ranges:

- Short = 6"
- Medium = 12"
- Long > 12"

Each turn, move 6" and take one action:

- Shoot
  - Bolt action, pump, etc = 1 ammo per shot max
  - Semi-auto = 3 ammo per shot max
  - Full-auto = as many as in magazine
- Sprint: move 1d6"
- Reload: restore all ammo
- Aim: next shoot action uses one die size bigger
- Overwatch: free shoot action against next enemy in line of sight (can interrupt moves)
- Switch Weapon: swap between weapons or gear
- Use Gear: throw grenade, use first aid kit, etc.

Equipment

- Ballistic plate: +1 HP
- First aid kit: restore 1 HP
- Flashbang: short range, targets can't act this round
- Smoke: short range, line of sight blocked by smoke
- Frag: short range, d10 attack
- Ballistic shield: moveable cover in one direction, heavy (1/2 speed)

Weapons:

- Assault Rifle: ammo 6d6, full-auto, medium range
- SMG: ammo 9d6, full-auto, short range
- Pistol: ammo 3d6, semi-auto, short range, quick draw (free action to swap and shoot)
- Sniper Rifle: ammo 3d8, bolt action, long range
- SAW: ammo 12d6, full-auto, medium range, heavy (1/2 speed)
- Shotgun: ammo 9d6, pump action, short range, use three ammo per shot, can't **aim**

Classes:

- Breacher: You carry a **breaching charge**. Use it to make an entryway wherever you want.
- Medic: First aid kits you carry gain an additional charge.
- Marksman: You can **aim** twice in a row (next shoot action uses two die sizes bigger).
- Squad Leader: You can give up your action to allow an ally to act on your turn (even if they've already acted this round).
- Grenadier: You have an underbarrel grenade launcher on your **assault rifle**. You can fire grenades at **medium range**.
- Scout: You move 2d6" when sprinting.
- Drone Operator: You have a **quadcopter drone** with 1 HP and move 12". Spend your action to control it.
- EOD Tech: You have a **bomb disposal robot** with 3 HP, move 3", and a mounted SMG. Spend your action to control it.
