Part 7 in [a series of posts](https://underwaterowlbear.github.io/tag/rangers) summarizing the history of rangers as a DnD class throughout the editions (both TSR and WOTC). 

Reference material: üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è.

## D&D 5th Edition (5e) - 2024

Proficient in light and medium armor and all weapons. Gains Weapon Mastery as a fighter.

**Prime Requisite**: Not applicable.

**Ability Score Requirements**: Not applicable.

**HD**: 1 at first level, d10 size (same as fighters).

**XP**: Not applicable - common experience point advancement chart.

**Spellcasting**: Can cast up to 5th level spells, starting at 1st level. Has a dedicated ranger spell list.

**Restrictions**: None.

**Benefits & Abilities**:

- Fighting Style: can choose from the normal options, plus *Druidic Warrior* (gain additional cantrips).
- Tracking: Survival as a class skill.
- Stealth as a class skill. Also gain Nature's Veil at 14th level.
- Favored enemy: Now centers on casting *Hunter's Mark* for a damage bonus. Loses all reference to specific creature types and tracking.
- Animal Handling as class skill.
- No special followers or animal companion in the base class.

**Subclasses**

- Hunter: this doesn't differ too much in flavor from the base ranger, offering increased damage and martial abilities.
- Beast Master: this emphasizes the "special companion" or "animal companion" feature from previous editions.
- Fey Wanderer: fairy ranger? Not bad, just not a typical historical archetype.
- Gloom Stalker: Underdark ranger, gaining darkvision.

## Analysis

Spellcasting at first level. Hunter's mark spell now a tentpole of the class, with several higher-level abilities buffing it. Tracking abilities de-emphasized. Favored enemy now no longer targeting a specific creature type. Which feels... bland? Overall I like this ranger the least. WotC somehow took the much-maligned-as-underpowered (yet flavorful!) 2014 ranger and swung the tiller too hard in the other direction. It feels as if it has been stripped of all flavor and ties to the setting, instead merely becoming a MOBA class dedicated to single-target DPS.
