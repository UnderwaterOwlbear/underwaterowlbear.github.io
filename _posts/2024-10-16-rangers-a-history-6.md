Part 6 in [a series of posts](https://underwaterowlbear.github.io/tag/rangers) summarizing the history of rangers as a DnD class throughout the editions (both TSR and WOTC). As reference material for this post, I will be using the [5.1 SRD](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf) and my hard copy of the *PHB*.

## D&D 5th Edition (5e) - 2014

Proficient in light and medium armor and all weapons.

**Prime Requisite**: Not applicable.

**Ability Score Requirements**: Not applicable.

**HD**: 1 at first level, d10 size (same as fighters).

**XP**: Not applicable - common experience point advancement chart.

**Spellcasting**: Can cast up to 5th level spells, starting at 2nd level. Has a dedicated ranger spell list.

**Restrictions**: None.

**Benefits & Abilities**:

- Combat style: can choose Archery, Defense, Dueling, Two-Weapon Fighting. Fighter has all these same options, plus Great Weapon Fighting and Protection (shields).
- Tracking: Survival as a class skill, and the Natural Explorer class feature grants Expertise and many other benefits when tracking or traveling in favored terrain.
- Stealth as a class skill. Also gain Hide in Plain Sight at 10th level. and Vanish at 14th level.
- Favored enemy: Advantage on tracking, but no damage bonus until the 20th level Foe Slayer capstone ability. Select 1 at first level and 2 more later on.
- Animal Handling as class skill.
- No special followers or animal companion in the base class.

**Subclasses**

- Hunter: this doesn't differ too much in flavor from the base ranger, offering increased damage and martial abilities.
- Beast Master: this emphasizes the "special companion" or "animal companion" feature from previous editions.

I know there are more subclasses in 5e splatbooks, but they generally delve into niche archetypes like underdark rangers and fey rangers. The sole exception I feel is the Monster Slayer - which expands the literary inspiration of the ranger to include witchers like Geralt of Rivia.

## Analysis

Spellcasting was buffed, being gained earlier and progressing to higher levels than in previous editions. Favored Enemy lost its damage bonus. Hide in Plain Sight and Vanish make the ranger even stealthier than the rogue at higher levels. The subclasses allow slight specialization into two of the historical areas of flavor for the class. Overall not bad. I typically like my rangers less mage-y than this, but the inclusion of witcher-rangers in *XgtE* is awesome.
