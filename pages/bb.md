## Character Creation

### Rules Summary

If coming from other old-school games, these are the assumptions used for a few important rules:

* HD are d6.
* To-hit bonus equal to HD.
* Ascending AC with unarmored AC = 10.
* Single saving throw (roll-over).
* Spellcasting as in *Wonder & Wickedness*

### Ability Scores

Roll 3d6 for each ability score. Scores of 14 or higher grant the bonus indicated on the table below.

| Ability       | Bonus for High (14+) Score                   |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Strength      | +1 damage in melee, +1 to open doors         |
| Dexterity     | +1 damage with missiles, +1 to initiative          |
| Constitution  | +3 HP                                        |
| Intelligence  | +1 spell known at 1st level                  |
| Wisdom        | Start with 500 XP (instead of 0 XP)          |
| Charisma      | +1 to reaction rolls and retainer morale     |

Table: Ability Scores

### Experience & Advancement

Pick a class. Start at 1st level with 0 experience points (XP), d6 maximum HP, and 3d6 silver pieces (sp). Gain 1 XP for every sp spent on carousing, partying, donating, gambling, or other pursuits without material reward. Slaying monsters may award XP as well, but this is significantly more dangerous and less rewarding than stealing treasure.

When a character gains a level, reroll all of their HD. If the total of the results is greater than their current maximum HP, the total becomes their new maximum HP.

### Hirelings

It costs 25sp to place an advertisement in a settlement for hirelings. The advertisement lasts for 1 week and provides d6-2 prospects for hiring. Hirelings are not brave or foolhardy enough to enter dungeons, but can be used for logistical support to and from dungeons and for guarding camp.

Table: Hirelings

**Horse archers** may act in both the move phase and the missile phase of combat.

## Encounters & Combat

### Surprise

To determine surprise, roll a d6 for each side that is unaware of their enemies. On a 5+, they are surprised. If a side is surprised, they are unable to act in the first round of combat.

**Common situations where players may surprise monsters:**.

* Bursting through a door on the first try.
* Entering a room by picking the a locked door.

**Common situations where monsters may surprise players:**

* The party has no light sources.
* The party enters a room after an unsuccessful attempt to force the door, if the party did not hear any noises before entering.

### Reactions

When encountering a wandering monster or other entity, and their disposition is unknown, roll 2d6 to determine their reaction.

| 2d6  | Reaction     |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 2-   | Hostile      |
| 3-5  | Negative     |
| 6-8  | Uncertain    |
| 9-11 | Positive     |
| 12+  | Enthusiastic |

Table: Reaction Roll Results

### Distance

Wandering monster encounters take place at the following distance, depending on location and whether any parties are surprised.

|               | Indoor         | Outdoor        |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Surprised     | 1 move away    | 1d4 moves away |
| Not Surprised | 1d4 moves away | 4d6 moves away |

Table: Distance of Encounters

### Initiative & Phases

To determine initiative within the combat round, each side rolls a d6 at the start of combat. The side with the highest result has the initiative. Combatants take their actions in the following phases, with the side having the initiative acting first in each phase.

**Phases:**

1. Magic, cast
2. Missile
3. Move
4. Melee, polearm
5. Melee, hand
6. Magic, effect

**Casting Interruptions** A spellcaster who is hit by an attack while casting a spell must make a saving throw. If he fails, the spell is lost (as if it were cast) and no effect takes place.

**Moving and Missiles** A combatant who looses a missile in the missile phase cannot move during the move phase.

### Attacks & Damage

**Basic Attacks** Roll a d20 and add to-hit bonus. Results that are equal to or greater than the target's armor class (AC) deal the weapon's damage to the target. The target reduces their HP by that much. Attack rolls of 20 are critical hits -- roll twice as many damage dice.

**Charge** In the first round of combat, a combatant may charge an enemy by moving from outside of melee range to within melee range of an enemy in the movement phase. The charging combatant gains advantage on their next attack against the charged enemy, and successful attacks roll twice as many damage dice.

**Withdraw** When a combatant within melee range of an enemy moves out of melee range, the enemy may immediately make a melee attack against the combatant. This can be avoided if the combatant only makes a half move.

**Combat Maneuvers** A combatant can choose to trip, disarm, blind, or otherwise perform a dirty trick on his opponent. He makes an attack and damage roll as normal. If he hits, his opponent can choose to take damage as normal, or suffer the effects of the combat manuever.

### Saving Throws

Some effects require characters to make saving throws. To do so, roll a d20 and compare the result to the character’s saving throw score on their character sheet. A result equal to or greater than the saving throw score is a success.

### Death & Healing

**Bind Wounds** Characters may bind their wounds after combat to restore 1d6 HP of damage sustained in that fight.

**Rest & Healing** Resting in camp for a night restores HP depending on the comfort of their camp. Resting in town or another civilized location for a week allows characters to restore all of their HP.

**Grievous Wounds** When a combatant reaches 0 HP, they must make a saving throw. On a failure, they die. On a success, they are merely grievously wounded -- roll on the table below to determine their injuries. When grievously wounded, characters may require rest in town to recover from their injuries.

| 2d6 | Grevious Wound                                                                                         |
|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2   | **Beheaded** Die instantly.                                                                            |
| 3   | **Dismembered Arm** Lose an arm.                                                                       |

### Morale

When a side takes 50% casualties, make a morale check to see if they break. Roll 2d6; a result equal to or greater than the morale score means that the side routs and flees the field. Morale is usually based on the combatants experience level, per the table below.  

| Experience | Morale Roll to Rout | Examples              |
|:-----------|:------------:|:----------------------|
| Green      | 6+            | Conscripts, levy      |
| Trained    | 7+            | Militia, town guards  |
| Veteran    | 8+            | Experienced fighters  |
| Elite      | 9+            | Knights, house guards |

Table: Morale Scores

**Undead** are always hostile, never check morale, and normally cannot be reasoned with (intelligent undead such as liches or vampires are an exception).  

### Evasion

**Evasion and Surprise** If the party surprises a monster, they can evade the monster automatically by retreating from the dungeon room or taking a circuitous wilderness path.

**Fleeing** If the monster is not surprised, and the party tries to flee, the monsters may give chase if the reaction roll indicates it. To successfully flee from a pursuer, the fleeing characters must each make a roll of 5+ on a d6. Encumbered characters have -1 on this roll. Unarmored characters have +1 on this roll. Failure means the monster catches up, and resumes its attack.

**Distractions** Food will always distract unintelligent monsters from the chase, by dropping 1 day's ration per monster HD. Treasure will always distract intelligent monsters from the chase, by dropping 100sp worth of treasure or coins per monster HD. Passing through a secret door will always evade a pursuer.

## Dungeon Delving

**The Clock**: When you enter the dungeon, the clock starts at 20 (use a spindown d20 from *MTG* for this). Each turn, roll 1d6 and subtract the result from the clock. When the clock hits 0, a wandering monster is encountered and the clock resets to 20.

**Turns**: One turn of dungeon exploration takes about ten minutes, and generally allows the party to take one action, such as:  

* Open a stuck or locked **door**
* Search the room thoroughly, revealing **traps** and **secret doors**
* Take a **short rest**
* Interact with a feature of the room, such as a **trap**
* Move to the next room

**Darkness**: When the party does not have a light source, 2d6 is rolled against the dungeon clock each turn instead of 1d6, and they are unable to find traps or secret doors regardless of time spent searching.

**Treasure Depletion:** When the party leaves a dungeon, 20% of the remaining treasure is lost or moved to a lower level of the dungeon.

### Doors

**Forcing Doors** All doors are stuck and must be burst open by force with a roll of 5+ on a d6. A failed attempt makes surprising whatever is behind the door impossible.

**Hear Noises** Characters can listen at doors and attempt to hear if the room is occupied. Note that the undead make no sound.

**Secret doors** require the room they are in to be searched completely (takes one turn, sometimes more for larger rooms) Some doors are locked, and require a key or a thief to pick the lock to open.

**Spiking Doors** Doors will open freely for monsters unless wedged shut with iron spikes. When wedged shut, monsters must attempt to burst the door open as above, possibly giving the party time to hear them coming. Doors can also be wedged open with spikes, to ensure the party a clear path of escape.

**Holding Doors** Sometimes (especially during a chase) the party will try to hold a door against pursing monsters. The side trying to force a held door must try to burst it open as normal (5+ on a d6).

### Traps

**Room Traps** are activated on a roll of 1 or 2 on a d6. They can be detected by spending a turn searching the area. Thieves can attempt to disarm traps; but be careful, as a failure will trigger the trap. If the character doesn't want to risk this, find a clever way to bypass the trap.

**Treasure Traps** such as locks with poison needles, or a weighted plate underneath a statuette, can only be detected by a thief spending a turn searching the treasure. Thieves can attempt to disarm them, but failure will trigger the trap.

## Wilderness Travel

Wilderness travel turns take place over turns of one day in length. Each day, the party may take one of the following actions:

* Move 2d6+8 miles towards another area
* Hunt, fish, or forage for d3 rations of food or water (natural features permitting)
* Explore the current area to reveal landmarks
* Visit a discovered landmark within the current area

Travelers must consume enough food and water each day, or they become **deprived** and cannot regain HD.

### Forced March

Travelers can conduct a forced march by foregoing making camp for the night, and traveling through the night instead. Travelers move a distance based on their overland speed as normal, however they are always surprised during encounters. Travelers will be **deprived** after a forced march for a number of nights equal to the number of forced marches they made.

### Wilderness Events

Every watch of travel, roll a d6 on the event table below.

| d6 | Event |
|:--:|:---------|
| 1  | **Encounter** Roll an encounter on the appropriate encounter table.  |
| 2  | **Clue** Roll the next encounter on the appropriate encounter table and foreshadow it with a clue (sound, smell, or sight).  |
| 3  | **Weather** Roll a d6: (1-3) weather gets worse by one step, (4-6) weather gets better by one step.   |
| 4  | **Free**, no effect   |
| 5  | **Free**, no effect   |
| 6  | **Free**, no effect   |

## Domains

At 9th level, a character can begin ruling their own domain. This might take the form of a fortress or manor house and its accompanying village for a fighter, a secluded tower or hut for a mage, or a hideout or tavern for a thief.

### Manor

Manors consist of the lord's keep (anything from a small fortified house, to an expansive castle, depending on the wealth of the lord) and the accompanying peasant population of the manor. The population density of a manor depends on the region in which the manor is located:

* Wilderness: d6-3 households per square mile
* Borderlands: d6 households per square mile
* Heartland: d6+3 households per square mile

The typical manor for a 9th level fighter is 2 to 3 square miles in size. If this is located in the borderlands, it will thus contain approximately 10 households.

Each household generates 1 sp in productive capacity every month. This consists mainly of food, cloth, and labor, rather than pure cash. The peasantry are typically taxed at 10%; higher taxation rates are possible but require a 2d6 roll to avoid an uprising. This is modifed by the lord's **Charisma** bonus.

| Tax Rate | Uprising on... |
|---|---|
| 10% | happy, no uprising |
| 15% | 10+ |
| 20% | 9+ |
| 25% | 8+ |
| 30% | 7+ |

Table: Peasant Uprisings

Peasants can provide one (1) levy (as light foot, 1HD, morale 6+) per household in times of war. Levy will serve for 6 weeks unpaid (though they must be supplied with food, either by their lord or through forage); beyond that, they must be paid wages as mercenaries or they immediately disperse. Even if paid, make a morale roll each week to see if they return to their farms regardless.

## Mass Combat

Each turn of mass combat, roll one (1) d6 per HD of creatures in the units in combat. A unit deals a hit on a result based on the armor of its enemy:

| Armor | Hit on... |
|---|---|
| Unarmored | 3+ |
| Light Armor | 4+ |
| Medium Armor | 5+ |
| Heavy Armor | 6+ |

Table: Mass Combat Hits

Shields are not counted in determination of armor in mass combat.

Each hit removes one enemy HD from combat as a casualty. Check morale as normal. Casualties check for survival with a result of 3+ on a d6 after combat. If they survive, they are **greviously wounded**.

## Appendix

### Monsters by HD

Monsters are able to see in complete darkness. When converting monsters from other publications, their saving throw and to-hit bonus should be based on the number of HD. A monster’s saving throw is found by subtracting it’s HD from 19 (for example, a 2 HD monster has a saving throw of 17). A monster has a to-hit bonus equal to its HD. HD should be converted to d6. Monsters typically deal d6 damage per attack, though particularly dangerous monsters might deal more.

| HD | HP | To-Hit Bonus | Saving Throw | XP Awarded |
|----|----|--------------|--------------|------------|
| <1 | 2  | +0           | 19+          | 10         |
| 1  | 4  | +1           | 18+          | 15         |
| 2  | 8  | +2           | 17+          | 30         |
| 3  | 12 | +3           | 16+          | 60         |
| 4  | 16 | +4           | 15+          | 120        |
| 5  | 20 | +5           | 14+          | 240        |
