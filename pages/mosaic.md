I have found that I have settled on a few [MOSAIC strict](http://blog.trilemma.com/2021/02/nothing-at-bottom-mosaic-strict-rpg.html) ways to handle some aspects of OSR/NSR/D&D/Elfgame play, and decide to compile them all here to reference in the future.

## Combat

**Morale**: Check morale at first casualty and again when a side takes 50% casualties. PCs and the undead never need to check morale. Morale is usually based on the combatants experience level, per the table below.  

| Experience | Morale Roll to Rout | Examples              |
|:-----------|:-------------------:|:----------------------|
| Green      | 6+                  | Conscripts, levy      |
| Trained    | 7+                  | Militia, town guards  |
| Veteran    | 8+                  | Experienced fighters  |
| Elite      | 9+                  | Knights, house guards |

**Fleeing** If the monster is not surprised, and the party tries to flee, the monsters may give chase if the reaction roll indicates it. To successfully flee from a pursuer, the fleeing characters must each make a roll of 5+ on a d6. Encumbered characters have -1 on this roll. Unarmored characters have +1 on this roll. Failure means the monster catches up, and resumes its attack.

**Distractions** Food will always distract unintelligent monsters from the chase, by dropping 1 day's ration per monster level. Treasure will always distract intelligent monsters from the chase, by dropping 100sp worth of treasure or coins per monster level. Passing through a secret door will always evade a pursuer.

**Healing**: Restore some health immediately after a fight. Heal some more health and recover all spells with a night's rest. Heal fully with a week's rest in town.

## Dungeon Delving

**The Clock**: When you enter the dungeon, the clock starts at 1 (use a spindown d20 from *MtG* for this). Each turn, roll 1d6 and add the result to the clock. When the clock hits 20, a wandering monster is encountered and the clock resets to 1.

**Turns**: One turn of dungeon exploration takes about ten minutes, and generally allows the party to take one action, such as:  

* Open a stuck or locked **door**
* Search the room thoroughly, revealing **traps** and **secret doors**
* Interact with a feature of the room, such as a **trap**
* Move to the next room

**Darkness**: When the party does not have a light source, 2d6 is rolled against the dungeon clock each turn instead of 1d6, and they are unable to find traps or secret doors regardless of time spent searching.

**Light Sources**: Torches, candles, lamps, or the like require a free hand to hold them. One such light source is required for every 4 dungeon explorers.

**Tunnelling**: One man can move a 5x5x5ft cube of dirt every 2 hours, or the same volume of rock every 4 hours. The appropriate tools such as pickaxes and shovels are required. Tunnels can be crawled through slowly if they measure 5x5ft, or walked through normally if they are 10x10ft.

## Doors

**Hear Noise**: Characters can listen at doors and attempt to hear if the room is occupied. Note that the undead make no sound.

**Forcing Doors**: All doors are stuck and must be burst open by force with a 5+. A failed attempt means you still burst open the door, but it makes surprising whatever is behind the door impossible.

**Locked Doors**: Some doors are locked, and require a key or a successful lockpicking attempt (5+) to open. A failed lockpicking attempt means that the lock is jammed and cannot be picked again, but does not alert the room's occupants.

**Secret Doors**: Secret doors can be discovered by spending a turn searching the room.

**Spiking Doors**: Doors will open freely for monsters and swing shut of their own accord, unless wedged with iron spikes. When wedged shut, monsters must attempt to burst the door open as above, possibly giving the party time to hear them coming. Doors can also be wedged open with spikes, to ensure the party a clear path of escape.

**Holding Doors**: Sometimes (especially during a chase) the party will try to hold a door against pursing monsters. The side trying to force a held door must try to burst it open as normal.

## Traps

**Room Traps** are activated on a roll of 1 or 2 on a d6. They can be detected by spending a turn searching the area. Thieves can attempt to disarm traps; but be careful, as a failure will trigger the trap. If the character doesn't want to risk this, find a clever way to bypass the trap.

**Treasure Traps**: Treasure traps such as locks with poison needles, or a weighted plate underneath a statuette, can only be detected by spending a turn searching the treasure. Characters can attempt to disarm them, but failure will trigger the trap.

## Wilderness Travel

Wilderness travel turns take place over turns of one day in length. Each day, the party may take one of the following actions:

* Move 2d6+8 miles towards another area
* Hunt, fish, or forage for d3 rations of food or water (natural features permitting)
* Explore the current area to reveal landmarks
* Travel within the current area to a discovered landmark

## Spell list

14. **Sleep**: Puts all within a small area (such as a melee, or a room) into a deep slumber. Subjects save to avoid.
15. **Speak with Dead**: Ask 1d6 questions of the corpse of a deceased intelligent creature. Reaction rolls apply and negotiation may be required. Corpse may be dead for a period of time based on spell level...

## Domains

At 9th level, a character can begin ruling their own domain. This might take the form of a fortress or manor house and its accompanying village for a fighter, a secluded tower or hut for a mage, or a hideout or tavern for a thief.

### Manor

**Manors** consist of the lord's keep (anything from a small fortified house, to an expansive castle, depending on the wealth of the lord) and the accompanying peasant population of the manor. The population density of a manor depends on the region in which the manor is located:

* **Wilderness**: d6-3 households per square mile
* **Borderlands**: d6 households per square mile
* **Heartland**: d6+3 households per square mile

The typical manor for a minor lord is 2 to 3 square miles in size. If this is located in the borderlands, it will thus contain approximately 10 households.

**Castles** cost ~80,000 coins and take an amount of time to build equal to sqrt(cost), or approximately 5 and a half years for a 80,000-coin castle.

**Taxes**: Each household generates 1 coin in productive capacity every month. This consists mainly of food, cloth, and labor, rather than pure cash. The peasantry are typically taxed at 10%; higher taxation rates are possible but require a 2d6 roll to avoid an uprising.

| Tax Rate | Uprising on...     |
|----------|--------------------|
| 10%      | happy, no uprising |
| 15%      | 10+                |
| 20%      | 9+                 |
| 25%      | 8+                 |
| 30%      | 7+                 |

Table: Peasant Uprisings

**Peasants** can provide one (1) levy (as light foot, 1HD, morale 6+) per household in times of war. Levy will serve for 6 weeks unpaid (though they must be supplied with food, either by their lord or through forage); beyond that, they must be paid wages as mercenaries or they immediately disperse. Even if paid, make a morale roll each week to see if they return to their farms regardless.
