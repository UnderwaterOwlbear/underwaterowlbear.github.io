## Combat

Takes place in 1-second rounds. In each round, may move 3 meters and take one action.

### Actions

**Shoot:** Roll d6+modifiers. Result of 4+ is a hit.

- Long range (>5m pistol or shotgun, >30m rifle), take -1
- If they are shooting back, take -1
- If behind concealment, take -1

If the target is behind cover, they cannot be harmed.

### Gunshot Wounds

Resolve hits with the following procedure:

1. Determine hit location.
2. Determine wound severity.
3. Determine armor effectiveness.

Hit locations:

| d8 | Hit location |
|----|--------------|
| 1  | Head         |
| 2  | Head         |
| 3  | Chest        |
| 4  | Gut          |
| 5  | L. Arm       |
| 6  | R. Arm       |
| 7  | L. Leg       |
| 8  | R. Leg       |

Wound severity:

| d8 | Head | Chest | Gut | Grenade | Arm or Leg |
|----|------|-------|-----|---------|------------|
| 1  | KIA  | KIA   | KIA | SW      | LW         |
| 2  | KIA  | KIA   | SW  | SW      | LW         |
| 3  | KIA  | KIA   | SW  | LW      | LW         |
| 4  | KIA  | KIA   | SW  | LW      | LW         |
| 5  | KIA  | KIA   | SW  | LW      | LW         |
| 6  | KIA  | KIA   | SW  | LW      | LW         |
| 7  | KIA  | SW    | SW  | LW      | LW         |
| 8  | SW   | SW    | SW  | LW      | LW         |

KIA = Killed In Action (immediately dead).  
SW = Seriously Wounded (out of the fight, will die if not taken to hospital in 1 hour).  
LW = Lightly Wounded (temporarily out of the fight, survival very likely as long as first aid provided within 3 minutes). 

LW on arm = actions at -1. LW on leg = halve movement. If both arms are shot, cannot take actions. If both legs are shot, cannot walk.

Grenades use the "Grenade" column regardless of hit location.

Body armor rated for the caliber of firearm will reduce Head and Chest wound severity by one step (KIA to SW, or SW to LW). Armor cannot reduce severity below lightly wounded.

Soft armor (kevlar vest) is rated for shotguns, handguns, and fragmentation grenades. It can be concealed under clothing.  
Hard armor (ceramic plate carrier and ballistic helmet) is rated for rifle rounds. It cannot be concealed.  

Any wound will be fatal unless stabilized within 3 minutes. Lightly wounded combatants can stabilize themselves with a tourniquet or simple bandages (1 minute). Seriously wounded combatants require another to stabilize them with chest seals, wound packing, junctional TQs, etc (takes 10 minutes).

Lightly wounded recover in 1-3 weeks. Seriously wounded recover in 1-3 months.
