Over on [*I Cast Light*](https://icastlight.blogspot.com/2023/03/mask-of-phantasmer-another-example-of.html), Warren D. references what he calls "french vanilla" fantasy:

> So what is "french vanilla"? I mean it to be a well-executed take on a familiar experience. Just as "french vanilla" ice cream is often a well-executed take on just regular vanilla. The flavor is enhanced, it might be served is just the right proportion, the texture is often richer, creamier, or heavier, and it might be served with an enhancement (coffee or a wafer) that adds to, but never overpowers the vanilla flavor itself.

> In terms of D&D, I believe it can be very helpful, especially for new DMs or DMs of new players, to use well-understood touchstones but apply a twist to them in order to maintain a true fantastical sense, but eliminate the need for game-halting explanation. To wit: players want to play D&D not listen to your fiction. And people's vocabulary of the fantastic has expanded with the advent of video games and the popularity of many fantasy media properties. Using "french vanilla" elements also helps a group get more mileage out of books and material they already have at hand. 

This has stuck with me, and I have long been pondering what my version of a "french vanilla" *DnD* setting would look like.

Hags are female trolls
DND Hobgoblins = Tolkien Orcs
Gnomes with hats and beards
Nixies are hags
Dragons
Giants? 
Ghouls happen when people turn into cannibals
