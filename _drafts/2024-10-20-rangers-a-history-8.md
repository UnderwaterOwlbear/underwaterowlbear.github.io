## Analysis

Consistent features of the ranger across all editions:

- Fighter-ish HD
- Spellcasting
- Favored enemy that usually grants a damage bonus
- Tracking ability
- Stealth / Surprise ability

Features present in TSR-era D&D (that are not shared with other classes from that era, like the mere fact that they have a prime requisite):

- Can wear heavy armor
- Has class restrictions (property, followers, alignment, group size)
- Spellcasting starts late in class and only grants low-level spells
- Favored enemy preset to "giant types" (orcs, goblins, and the like)
- Special followers at higher levels
- Use of scrying magic items

Features present in WotC-era D&D:

- Lose access to heavy armor
- No restrictions
- Spellcasting starts earlier and grants higher level spells
- Favored enemy type is player-chosen
- Animal Empathy and an Animal Companion
- Fighting styles, particularly two-weapon fighting and archery
