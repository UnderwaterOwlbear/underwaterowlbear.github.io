## Core Mechanic

Test: Roll 2d6+mod, 8+ succeeds.

Opposed Roll: Each side rolls 2d6+mod, higher number wins.

## Character Creation

Assign +3 between Strength (STR), Skill (SKL), Spirit (SPI) (max +2 in any one). Can take a -1 to an ability, once, to gain an additional +1 to another ability.

HP = 1 + STR

## Single Combat

Roll 2d6+STR opposed. Winner takes 1 damage. Armor absorbs 1, 2, or 3 damage before breaking. Test STR at 0 HP to avoid death.

## Population & Demography

### Densities

- Sparse = 1d6 people / sqmi
- Borderland = 2d6 people / sqmi
- Heartland = 3d6 people / sqmi

### Military Recruitment

- 1 light or medium foot per 20 people (5%)
- 1 heavy horse or heavy foot per 200 people (0.5%)
- nomadic pastoralists can muster 1 light horse archer per 10 people (10%). but these societies only sustain spare population densities (1d6 people per sqmi).

Mark a grid square as "mustered" once soldiers are recruited from it. Squares that have already been mustered cannot be mustered a second time. Once the regiment mustered from it is disbanded and the people return, clear the "mustered" status.

### Cities

For every 100 rural farmers, have 5 city folk (~5% urbanization rate). 

The largest cities are typically around 10,000 people. this means a large city is supported by 200,000 farmers. with a typical population density of 10 people / sqmi, this city requires 20,000 sqmi of farmland (or 200 squares)

Cities require 100 sqmi or farmland (1 grid square) per 50 people living in it (20 squares per 1,000 people).

## Mapping & Travel

Square grid of 10mi per side. 100 sqmi. diagonal distance of 15 mi.

Travel speeds

| Group Size & State    | Normal (mi/day) | Forced March (mi/day) | Normal (mi/wk) | Forced March (mi/wk) |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Army                  | 10              | 15                    | 60             | 105                  |
| Individual or Party   | 15              | 25                    | 90             | 175                  |
| Mounted Ind. or Party | 20              | 40                    | 120            | 280                  |
| Mounted Army          | 15              | 30                    | 90             | 210                  |

After each week of forced march, -1 Morale then test Morale.

Armies must travel on roads. Individuals and parties may travel overland.

## Food & Forage

A person can carry 50 lb.

1 bushel of grain feeds 1 person for 1 month and weighs 50 lb.

Thus, an army needs 250 bushels per week per 1,000 soldiers.

An army can carry 1 week of food on its backs, and an additional week if it carries a wagon train. harsh environments such as deserts deplete supplies at double the rate since water must be carried as well as food.

An army disbands after 2 weeks without food.

Assume peasant farmers are subsistence farmers and retain barely enough grain to last the year (12 bushels per person). approximately 1/12 (8%) of this is able to be foraged by an invading army before the peasants flee or hide the rest. thus, a given grid square contains 1 bushel of available forage per 1 person living in it. in the fall and winter, this halves to 1 bushel per 2 people.

A foraged square restocks its food each year with the fall harvest.

Armies with cavalry may forage adjacent squares as well as the square occupied by the army.

### Carrying Capacity

| Transport     | Carrying Capacity   |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Mule          | 2x men              |
| Horse, Riding | 2x men              |
| Horse, War    | 3x men              |
| Ox            | 6x men              |
| Cart, hand    | 2x men              |
| Cart, draft   | 2x beast pulling it |
| Wagon         | 4x beast pulling it |

## Time & Calendars

12 months of 4 weeks each

7 days per week, 28 per month, 336 days per year.

Same as Earth.

## Money & Economics

1 pound sterling silver (L) = 240 silver pennies (d)

L = "pound" or "lira"  
d = "penny", "pence", or "dinar"  

Average peasant household earns ~1 L per year. this means approximately 240 d / yr or 20 d / month.

If a peasant household contains 5 people, and thus produces 5 bushels of grain per month, a bushel of grain will cost (in non-famine years), approximately 4 d. famines can increase this by up to 10x.

Since 1 bushel feeds 1 person for 1 month (4 weeks), and costs 4 d, 1 week of food costs 1 d.

10% of this is taxed to the state and 10% to the church (24 d / yr or 2 d / mo each). useful for domain level income. note that this is mostly in-kind (grain or household goods).

### Prices of Goods

| Availability | Cost        |
|--------------|-------------|
| Abundant     | 1 d         |
| Common       | 1d6 d       |
| Uncommon     | 1d6 x 10 d  |
| Rare         | 1d6 x 100 d |
| Expensive    | 1d6 L       |


| Abundant goods:     | Common goods:                         | Uncommon goods:             | Rare goods:               | Expensive goods:           |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
|   One week of bread |   One week of simple but varied food. |   One week of fancy food.   |   A warhorse.             |   A suit of mail or plate. |

## Warfare, or *Dominium Expediti Antiquitatis*

### Design Notes

I have taken elements of my three favorite fast-play wargames, put them into a blender, and created this chimera. Intent is to use this for solo resolution of battles as part of a solo campaign, or as part of domain-level play in the background of another TTRPG such as D&D.

Sources that I pillaged to create this include:

- [Kal-Arath](https://castlegrief.itch.io/kal-arath) by [Castle Grief](https://castlegrief.substack.com/)
- [Cataphract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iKPvuuBMyDo4imzIbZiVTIvr_s2XJb7PZzuJ123Tg5Y/edit?usp=sharing) by [Sam Sorensen](https://samsorensen.blot.im/).
- Bret Devereaux's [Total Generalship](https://acoup.blog/2022/05/27/collections-total-generalship-commanding-pre-modern-armies-part-i-reports/) series on his *ACOUP* blog.
- Bob Cordery's [Portable Wargame](http://wargamingmiscellany.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html), in particular the [3x3 Fast Play variant](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1834456900102155/permalink/3099117333636099/) developed by Mark Cordone in 2022.
- [De Bellis Antiquitatis](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/299/de-bellis-antiquitatis-quick-play-wargame-rules-wi), particularly v3.0.
- [Dominion of the Spear](https://www.wargamevault.com/product/507147/Dominion-of-the-Spear) by Ork Publishing. 

Hence the name, "Dominium Expediti Antiquitatis", meaning "The Dominion of Portable Antiquity" (or thereabouts, according to Google Translate...). *DEA* for short?

Intent is to use simple flat tokens of cardboard, chipboard, or MDF. Though I'm sure miniatures would work just as well.

### Battlefield

```
|	    Reserve		    |
| Left | Center | Right |
| Left | Center | Right |
|	    Reserve		    |
```

### Armies

**Light Foot**: Count as 1/2 when determining numerical superiority, unless in rough terrain.  
*Lightly armed and armored infantry fighting in open order such as peltasts, psiloi, Irish kern, and velites. Or alternatively, massed troops armed with ranged weapons such as longbowmen and crossbowmen.*

**Medium Foot**: No special abilities.     
*Massed infantry of varying arms and armor fighting in close order. Spearmen, huscarls, most town militia, etc.*

**Heavy Foot**: Count as double when determining numerical superiority.  
*Massed infantry bearing heavy arms and fully armored. Hoplites, European men-at-arms, legionaries.*

**Light Horse**: May freely redeploy from one sector of the battlefield to another.
*Steppe nomads and horse archers, or Roman auxilia cavalry.* 

**Heavy Horse**: Count as double when determining numerical superiority.  
*Heavily armed and armored mounted troops, such as European knights or cataphracts.*   

Intent is to describe units in deigetic terms, using the real number of men in the unit. Examples:

*VI Cohort, Legio IIX. 480 heavy infantry*

*Varangian Guard. 100 medium infantry*

*Davaa's Mingghan. 1,000 light horse*

*Cheshire Bowmen. 500 light foot*

### Tactical Factors

Determined on a sector-by-sector basis:

- Numerical superiority: +1 per 100% more soldiers than opponent. For *D&D* monster conversion, count as a number of soldiers equal to HD.
- Terrain: -1 if in rough terrain.
- Slope: -1 if fighting uphill.

Determined once and applied to all units on a side:

- Supplies: -1 if underfed.
- Weather: -1 if bad weather.
- Tactics: commander rolls 2d6+SKI before battle; on result of 8+, gain +1 in battle due to the commander's clever tactics
- Morale: an army has a Morale score (MOR) of -2 to +2. In the greater operational wargame described above, I intend for this to rise and fall over a campaign as various events occur. For a skirmish, could set to whatever you'd like, or keep both sides at +0.

### Setup

Place terrain. Maybe I'll put a balanced tournament-style terrain drafting mechanic in here eventually, but for now it is narrative placement.  

- Hill: Only one per sector. Takes up 1/2 sector (only one side is on the hill).
- Rough Terrain: Takes up full sector. Woods, Marsh, BuA, etc.

Assign units to each sector. You may assign multiple units to each sector, or hold units in reserve, so long as there is at least one unit in each sector (left, center, right).

Yes, this means armies must be comprised of at least 3 distinct units. 

Finally, note your general's location. They can start in any sector or in the reserve area.

### Sequence of Play

1. Resolve combat from left to right.
2. Each side in a sector rolls a 2d6 + modifiers:
    - +MOR of army
    - +SPI of commander if commander is attached to unit (bonus only to that sector).
    - +Tactical factors per above.
3. Compare scores. Highest wins in that sector. Refight ties.
4. If a unit loses, its side may deploy a unit from their reserve to the defeated sector. Refight the battle in that sector in the next round with the newly arrived unit. A side can only do this if both of the following states are true:
    - That side's commander is in reserve
    - There is at least one unit in reserve available to deploy
5. Defeated units are removed from the battlefield. If a side controls a sector by defeating all enemy units in that sector and they are not reinforced from reserves, that side wins that sector.
6. Determine winner. Side who wins at least 2 of the 3 sectors wins the battle. 
The commander himself may deploy from the reserve and attach himself to a unit in a sector at any point in the battle. But he may not return from that sector to the reserve once deployed. This represents a general committing himself to reinforce an area of the battlefield, similar to Alexander the Great with his Companion cavalry.

### Results

If commander attached to unit and loses in that sector, 1-in-6 chance of capture.

If won in 2 sectors: Winner suffers 5% casualties and gains +1 Morale. Loser suffers 10% casualties and loses -1 Morale.

If won in all 3 sectors: Winner suffers 5% casualties and gains +1 Morale. Loser suffers 20% casualties, loses -2 Morale, and 1-in-6 chance commander is captured.

### Sieges

Defenders get -1.

+10% casualties to losing side.

Town garrisons start testing morale after 1 week

Cities after 1 month

Fortresses after 3 months

-1 Morale per week, test Morale each week.

**Fortifications** take a number of months to build equal to `2 * sqrt(cost in L)`. See table below for details.

| Fortification Type   | Cost (L) | Time       | Max Garrison | Tactical Bonus |
|----------------------|----------|------------|--------------|----------------|
| Hasty Fieldworks     |          | 1 day      | 1,000's      | +1             |
| Fortified Encampment |          | 2 days     | 10,000's     | +2             |
| Town Walls           |          |            | 1,000's      | +3             |
| City Walls           |          |            | 10,000's     | +4             |
| Tower                | 200      | 28 months  | 10's         | +5             |
| Keep                 | 1,300    | 73 months  | 100's        | +5             |
| Castle               | 7,000    | 167 months | 1,000's      | +5             |

## Dungeon Delving

**The Clock**: When you enter the dungeon, the clock starts at 1 (use a spindown d20 from *MtG* for this). Each turn, roll 1d6 and add the result to the clock. When the clock hits 20, a wandering monster is encountered and the clock resets to 1.

**Turns**: One turn of dungeon exploration takes about ten minutes, and generally allows the party to take one action, such as:  

* Open a stuck or locked **door**
* Search the room thoroughly, revealing **traps** and **secret doors**
* Interact with a feature of the room, such as a **trap**
* Move to the next room

**Darkness**: When the party does not have a light source, 2d6 is rolled against the dungeon clock each turn instead of 1d6, and they are unable to find traps or secret doors regardless of time spent searching.

**Light Sources**: Torches, candles, lamps, or the like require a free hand to hold them. One such light source is required for every 4 dungeon explorers.

**Tunnelling**: One man can move a 5x5x5ft cube of dirt every 2 hours, or the same volume of rock every 4 hours. The appropriate tools such as pickaxes and shovels are required. Tunnels can be crawled through slowly if they measure 5x5ft, or walked through normally if they are 10x10ft.

### Doors

**Hear Noise**: Characters can listen at doors and attempt to hear if the room is occupied. Note that the undead make no sound.

**Forcing Doors**: All doors are stuck and must be burst open by force with a 5+. A failed attempt means you still burst open the door, but it makes surprising whatever is behind the door impossible.

**Locked Doors**: Some doors are locked, and require a key or a successful lockpicking attempt (5+) to open. A failed lockpicking attempt means that the lock is jammed and cannot be picked again, but does not alert the room's occupants.

**Secret Doors**: Secret doors can be discovered by spending a turn searching the room.

**Spiking Doors**: Doors will open freely for monsters and swing shut of their own accord, unless wedged with iron spikes. When wedged shut, monsters must attempt to burst the door open as above, possibly giving the party time to hear them coming. Doors can also be wedged open with spikes, to ensure the party a clear path of escape.

**Holding Doors**: Sometimes (especially during a chase) the party will try to hold a door against pursing monsters. The side trying to force a held door must try to burst it open as normal.

### Traps

**Room Traps** are activated on a roll of 1 or 2 on a d6. They can be detected by spending a turn searching the area. Thieves can attempt to disarm traps; but be careful, as a failure will trigger the trap. If the character doesn't want to risk this, find a clever way to bypass the trap.

**Treasure Traps**: Treasure traps such as locks with poison needles, or a weighted plate underneath a statuette, can only be detected by spending a turn searching the treasure. Characters can attempt to disarm them, but failure will trigger the trap.
