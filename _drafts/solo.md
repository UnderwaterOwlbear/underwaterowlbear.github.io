## Core Mechanic

Test: Roll 2d6+mod, 8+ succeeds.

Opposed Roll: Each side rolls 2d6+mod, higher number wins.

## Character Creation

Assign +3 between Strength (STR), Skill (SKL), Spirit (SPI) (max +2 in any one). Can take a -1 to an ability, once, to gain an additional +1 to another ability.

HP = 1 + STR

## Population & Demography

### Densities

- Sparse = 1d6 people / sqmi
- Borderland = 2d6 people / sqmi
- Heartland = 3d6 people / sqmi

### Military Recruitment

- 1 light or medium foot per 20 people (5%)
- 1 heavy horse or heavy foot per 200 people (0.5%)
- nomadic pastoralists can muster 1 light horse archer per 10 people (10%). but these societies only sustain spare population densities (1d6 people per sqmi).

Mark a grid square as "mustered" once soldiers are recruited from it. Squares that have already been mustered cannot be mustered a second time. Once the regiment mustered from it is disbanded and the people return, clear the "mustered" status.

### Cities

For every 100 rural farmers, have 5 city folk (~5% urbanization rate). 

The largest cities are typically around 10,000 people. this means a large city is supported by 200,000 farmers. with a typical population density of 10 people / sqmi, this city requires 20,000 sqmi of farmland (or 200 squares)

Cities require 100 sqmi or farmland (1 grid square) per 50 people living in it (20 squares per 1,000 people).

## Mapping & Travel

Square grid of 10mi per side. 100 sqmi. diagonal distance of 15 mi.

Travel speeds

| Group Size & State    | Normal (mi/day) | Forced March (mi/day) | Normal (mi/wk) | Forced March (mi/wk) |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Army                  | 10              | 15                    | 60             | 105                  |
| Individual or Party   | 15              | 25                    | 90             | 175                  |
| Mounted Ind. or Party | 20              | 40                    | 120            | 280                  |
| Mounted Army          | 15              | 30                    | 90             | 210                  |

After each week of forced march, -1 Morale then test Morale.

Armies must travel on roads. Individuals and parties may travel overland.

## Food & Forage

1 bushel of grain feeds 1 person for 1 month and weighs 50 lb.

Thus, an army needs 250 bushels per week per 1,000 soldiers.

An army can carry 1 week of food on its backs, and an additional week if it carries a wagon train. harsh environments such as deserts deplete supplies at double the rate since water must be carried as well as food.

An army disbands after 2 weeks without food.

Assume peasant farmers are subsistence farmers and retain barely enough grain to last the year (12 bushels per person). approximately 1/12 (8%) of this is able to be foraged by an invading army before the peasants flee or hide the rest. thus, a given grid square contains 1 bushel of available forage per 1 person living in it. in the fall and winter, this halves to 1 bushel per 2 people.

A foraged square restocks its food each year with the fall harvest.

Armies with cavalry may forage adjacent squares as well as the square occupied by the army.

## Time & Calendars

12 months of 4 weeks each

7 days per week, 28 per month, 336 days per year.

Same as Earth.

## Money & Economics

1 pound sterling silver (L) = 240 silver pennies (d)

L = "pound" or "lira"  
d = "penny", "pence", or "dinar"  

Average peasant household earns ~1 L per year. this means approximately 240 d / yr or 20 d / month.

If a peasant household contains 5 people, and thus produces 5 bushels of grain per month, a bushel of grain will cost (in non-famine years), approximately 4 d. famines can increase this by up to 10x.

Since 1 bushel feeds 1 person for 1 month (4 weeks), and costs 4 d, 1 week of food costs 1 d.

10% of this is taxed to the state and 10% to the church (24 d / yr or 2 d / mo each). useful for domain level income. note that this is mostly in-kind (grain or household goods).

### Prices of Goods

| Availability | Cost        |
|--------------|-------------|
| Abundant     | 1 d         |
| Common       | 1d6 d       |
| Uncommon     | 1d6 x 10 d  |
| Rare         | 1d6 x 100 d |
| Expensive    | 1d6 L       |


| Abundant goods:     | Common goods:                         | Uncommon goods:             | Rare goods:               | Expensive goods:           |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
|   One week of bread |   One week of simple but varied food. |   One week of fancy food.   |   A warhorse.             |   A suit of mail or plate. |

|                     |                                       |   A fine weapon.            |                           |                            |

## Warfare, or *Dominium Expediti Antiquitatis*

### Design Notes

I have taken elements of my three favorite fast-play wargames, put them into a blender, and created this chimera. Intent is to use this for solo resolution of battles as part of a solo campaign, or as part of domain-level play in the background of another TTRPG such as D&D.

Sources that I pillaged to create this include:

- [Kal-Arath](https://castlegrief.itch.io/kal-arath) by [Castle Grief](https://castlegrief.substack.com/)
- [Cataphract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iKPvuuBMyDo4imzIbZiVTIvr_s2XJb7PZzuJ123Tg5Y/edit?usp=sharing) by [Sam Sorensen](https://samsorensen.blot.im/).
- Bret Devereaux's [Total Generalship](https://acoup.blog/2022/05/27/collections-total-generalship-commanding-pre-modern-armies-part-i-reports/) series on his *ACOUP* blog.
- Bob Cordery's [Portable Wargame](http://wargamingmiscellany.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html), in particular the [3x3 Fast Play variant](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1834456900102155/permalink/3099117333636099/) developed by Mark Cordone in 2022.
- [De Bellis Antiquitatis](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/299/de-bellis-antiquitatis-quick-play-wargame-rules-wi), particularly v3.0.
- [Dominion of the Spear](https://www.wargamevault.com/product/507147/Dominion-of-the-Spear) by Ork Publishing. 

Hence the name, "Dominium Expediti Antiquitatis", meaning "The Dominion of Portable Antiquity" (or thereabouts, according to Google Translate...). *DEA* for short?

Intent is to use simple flat tokens of cardboard, chipboard, or MDF. Though I'm sure miniatures would work just as well.

### Battlefield

```
|	    Reserve		    |
| Left | Center | Right |
| Left | Center | Right |

```

### Armies

**Light Foot**: Count as 1/2 when determining numerical superiority, unless in rough terrain.  
*Lightly armed and armored infantry fighting in open order such as peltasts, psiloi, Irish kern, and velites. Or alternatively, massed troops armed with ranged weapons such as longbowmen and crossbowmen.*

**Medium Foot**: No special abilities.     
*Massed infantry of varying arms and armor fighting in close order. Spearmen, huscarls, most town militia, etc.*

**Heavy Foot**: Count as double when determining numerical superiority.  
*Massed infantry bearing heavy arms and fully armored. Hoplites, European men-at-arms, legionaries.*

**Light Horse**: No special abilities.    
*Steppe nomads and horse archers, or Roman auxilia cavalry.* 

**Heavy Horse**: Count as double when determining numerical superiority.  
*Heavily armed and armored mounted troops, such as European knights or cataphracts.*   

Intent is to describe units in deigetic terms, using the real number of men in the unit. Examples:

*VI Cohort, Legio IIX. 480 heavy infantry*

*Varangian Guard. 100 medium infantry*

*Davaa's Mingghan. 1,000 light horse*

*Cheshire Bowmen. 500 light foot*

### Tactical Factors

Determine tactical factors on a per-sector basis.

- Numerical superiority: +1 per 100% more soldiers than opponent. For *D&D* monster conversion, count as a number of soldiers equal to HD.
- Terrain: -1 if in rough terrain.
- Slope: -1 if fighting uphill. 
- Supplies: -1 if underfed.
- Weather: -1 if bad weather.
- Tactics: commander tests SKI before battle; on success, gain +1 due to commander's clever tactics

### Setup

Place terrain. Maybe I'll put a balanced tournament-style terrain drafting mechanic in here eventually, but for now it is narrative placement.  

- Hill: Only one per sector. Takes up 1/2 sector (only one side is on the hill).
- Rough Terrain: Takes up full sector. Woods, Marsh, BuA, etc.

Assign units to each sector. You may assign multiple units to each sector, or hold units in reserve, so long as there is at least one unit in each sector (left, center, right).

Yes, this means armies must be comprised of at least 3 distinct units. 

Finally, note your general's location. They can start in any sector or in the reserve area.

### Sequence of Play

1. Resolve combat from left to right.
2. Each side in a sector rolls a 2d6 + modifiers:
    - +MOR of army
    - +SPI of commander if commander is attached to unit (bonus only to that sector).
3. Compare scores. Highest wins in that sector. Refight ties.  
4. If a unit loses and both (1) commander is in reserve, and (2) there are units in reserve, may deploy a unit from reserve to defeated sector and refight battle in that sector.
5. Determine winner. Side who wins at least 2 of the 3 sectors wins the battle. 

Commander may deploy from reserve to a unit in the sector at any point, but may not return from sector to reserve once deployed.

### Results

If commander attached to unit and loses in that sector, 1-in-6 chance of capture.

If won in 2 sectors: Winner suffers 5% casualties and gains +1 Morale. Loser suffers 10% casualties and loses -1 Morale.

If won in all 3 sectors: Winner suffers 5% casualties and gains +1 Morale. Loser suffers 20% casualties, loses -2 Morale, and 1-in-6 chance commander is captured.
