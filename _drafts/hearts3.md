## Saving Throws

To make a saving throw, roll under your skill on a d20 to succeed. If you fail, suffer a consequence, but increase your ST by 1.

## Combat

**Reaction Rolls**: When encountering a wandering monster or other entity, and their disposition is unknown, *test the appropriate language skill* to see if you can negotiate with them. On a failure, they are offended by your accent, and attack.

**Initiative**: Roll for initiative. Each side rolls d6, highest goes first.

**Attacking**:

1. Choose opponent.
2. Roll weapon dice. Deal damage based on the result:
    * no hits on 3 or less
    * 1 hit on 4+
    * 2 hits on 8+
    * 3 hits on 12+
3. Hits are applied. Remove **AP** first, then **HP**
4. When out of **HP**, dead or dying (or **Critical Damage** effect if using *Cairn* monsters)

**Morale**: Per [MOSAIC rules](/pages/mosaic.html).

## Healing

Restore all **AP** at end of combat. Restore one **HP** *or* all **Mana** per night's rest. Restore all **HP** and **Mana** with a week's rest in town.

2. **Augury**: Perform a divination to determine whether a given course of action will result in "weal" or "woe". The caster may ask one question per level. DM rolls a d6 secretly: on a 4+, the answer is truthful. Sacrifice one **HP** in blood to guarantee a truthful answer.
3. **Charm**: Hostile creatures become neutral, neutral become friendly, and friendly creatures become infatuated. Affects a number of creatures equal to **Mana** spent.
4. **Circle of Protection**: Draw a circle on the ground with chalk, salt, or blood. Undead, fey, demons, or other unnatural creatures cannot cross the boundary. Protects one creature per **Mana** spent.
5. **Control Weather**: Control the weather, causing clear skies, storms, winds, etc as desired. Effects last for 1 day per **Mana** spent.
6. **Dominate**: Release control of your own body and domineer that of a nearby creature. Subject saves to prevent.
7. **Fireball**: Deals 1 damage per **Mana** spent to all targets in a small area (such as a melee or a room). Targets save for half damage.
8. **Fly**: Fly at walking speed. Affects one creature per level. Spell is reliable for 10 minutes per **Mana** spent, then has a chance to end on each subsequent turn on a roll of 5+ on a d6.
9. **Hold Person**: Paralyzes a number of creatures equal to **Mana** spent. Subjects save to avoid.
10. **Invisibility**: Turn one creature per **Mana** spent invisible.

14. **Sleep**: Puts all within a small area (such as a melee, or a room) into a deep slumber. Subjects save to avoid.
15. **Speak with Dead**: Ask 1d6 questions of the corpse of a deceased intelligent creature. Reaction rolls apply and negotiation may be required. Corpse may be dead for a period of time based on **Mana** spent...

    | **Mana** spent | Deceased for... |
    |-------------|-----------------|
    | 1           | 1 week          |
