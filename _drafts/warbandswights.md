## Monsters

Monsters are rated by how many men they fight as. For example, a monster that "fights as 4 men" can sustain 4 hits before dying and rolls 4 attack dice.

|Barrow-Wight |3| 6+| Corrupting blow|

## Overland Travel

One sack holds one of the following:

- All of your arms and gear
- 4 supplies
- A treasure
- 3,000 coins.

You can carry one sack easily. You can carry a second sack, but you are encumbered. Mules can carry five sacks. Horses can carry a rider and two sacks. Each person consumes one supply per day.

A day is divided into three watches. If unencumbered or mounted, you can march 12 miles per watch. If encumbered and unmounted, movement is halved. If traveling at night, movement is halved (and is only possible if you have light sources).

You can march for two watches without issue. Marching for a third or subsequent watch without a break forces a saving throw. On a failure, take one hit of damage.

During the summer half of the year, a day has two daylight watches and one nighttime watch. During the winter half of the year, it has one daylight watch and two nighttime watches.

## Towns & Villages

One square mile of farmland can support 40 farmers, and an additional 5 townsfolk in a nearby urban area. It generates 50 coins per year in taxes. Purchasing a square mile of land costs 1,200 coins. In times of war, one warrior can be mobilized per square mile at a cost of 50 coins per month.
