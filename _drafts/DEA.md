### Design Notes

I have taken elements of my three favorite fast-play wargames, put them into a blender, and created this chimera. Intent is to use this for solo resolution of battles as part of a solo campaign, or as part of domain-level play in the background of another TTRPG such as D&D.

Sources that I pillaged to create this include:

- [Kal-Arath](https://castlegrief.itch.io/kal-arath) by [Castle Grief](https://castlegrief.substack.com/)
- [Cataphract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iKPvuuBMyDo4imzIbZiVTIvr_s2XJb7PZzuJ123Tg5Y/edit?usp=sharing) by [Sam Sorensen](https://samsorensen.blot.im/).
- Bret Devereaux's [Total Generalship](https://acoup.blog/2022/05/27/collections-total-generalship-commanding-pre-modern-armies-part-i-reports/) series on his *ACOUP* blog.
- Bob Cordery's [Portable Wargame](http://wargamingmiscellany.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html), in particular the [3x3 Fast Play variant](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1834456900102155/permalink/3099117333636099/) developed by Mark Cordone in 2022.
- [De Bellis Antiquitatis](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/299/de-bellis-antiquitatis-quick-play-wargame-rules-wi), particularly v3.0.
- [Dominion of the Spear](https://www.wargamevault.com/product/507147/Dominion-of-the-Spear) by Ork Publishing. 

Hence the name, "Dominium Expediti Antiquitatis", meaning "The Dominion of Portable Antiquity" (or thereabouts, according to Google Translate...). *DEA* for short?

Intent is to use simple flat tokens of cardboard, chipboard, or MDF. Though I'm sure miniatures would work just as well.

### Commander Creation

Assign +2 points amongst skill (SKI) and spirit (SPI). Possible scores are thus:

+0, +2  
+1, +1  
+2, +0

### Battlefield

```
|	    Reserve		    |
| Left | Center | Right |
| Left | Center | Right |
|	    Reserve		    |
```

### Armies

**Light Foot**: Count as 1/2 when determining numerical superiority, unless in rough terrain.  
*Lightly armed and armored infantry fighting in open order such as peltasts, psiloi, Irish kern, and velites. Or alternatively, massed troops armed with ranged weapons such as longbowmen and crossbowmen.*

**Medium Foot**: No special abilities.     
*Massed infantry of varying arms and armor fighting in close order. Spearmen, huscarls, most town militia, etc.*

**Heavy Foot**: Count as double when determining numerical superiority.  
*Massed infantry bearing heavy arms and fully armored. Hoplites, European men-at-arms, legionaries.*

**Light Horse**: No special abilities.    
*Steppe nomads and horse archers, or Roman auxilia cavalry.* 

**Heavy Horse**: Count as double when determining numerical superiority.  
*Heavily armed and armored mounted troops, such as European knights or cataphracts.*   

Intent is to describe units in deigetic terms, using the real number of men in the unit. Examples:

*VI Cohort, Legio IIX. 480 heavy infantry*

*Varangian Guard. 100 medium infantry*

*Davaa's Mingghan. 1,000 light horse*

*Cheshire Bowmen. 500 light foot*

### Tactical Factors

- Numerical superiority: +1 per 100% more soldiers than opponent. For *D&D* monster conversion, count as a number of soldiers equal to HD.
- Terrain: -1 if in rough terrain.
- Slope: -1 if fighting uphill. 
- Supplies: -1 if underfed.
- Weather: -1 if bad weather.
- Tactics: commander tests SKI before battle; on success, gain +1 due to commander's clever tactics

### Setup

Place terrain. Maybe I'll put a balanced tournament-style terrain drafting mechanic in here eventually, but for now it is narrative placement.  

- Hill: Only one per sector. Takes up 1/2 sector (only one side is on the hill).
- Rough Terrain: Takes up full sector. Woods, Marsh, BuA, etc.

Assign units to each sector. You may assign multiple units to each sector, or hold units in reserve, so long as there is at least one unit in each sector.

Yes, this means armies must be comprised of at least 3 distinct units. 

Finally, note your general's location. They can start in any sector or in the reserve area.

### Sequence of Play

1. Resolve combat from left to right.
2. Each side in a sector rolls a 2d6 + modifiers:
    - +MOR of army
    - +SPI of commander if commander is attached to unit (bonus only to that sector).
3. Compare scores. Highest wins in that sector. Refight ties.  
4. If a unit loses and both (1) commander is in reserve, and (2) there are units in reserve, may deploy a unit from reserve to defeated sector and refight battle in that sector.
5. Determine winner. Side who wins at least 2 of the 3 sectors wins the battle. 

Commander may deploy from reserve to a unit in the sector at any point, but may not return from sector to reserve once deployed.

### Results

If commander attached to unit and loses in that sector, 1-in-6 chance of capture.

If won in 2 sectors: Winner suffers 5% casualties and gains +1 Morale. Loser suffers 10% casualties and loses -1 Morale.

If won in all 3 sectors: Winner suffers 5% casualties and gains +1 Morale. Loser suffers 20% casualties, loses -2 Morale, and 1-in-6 chance commander is captured.
