## Dominium Expediti Antiquitatis

### Design Notes

I have taken elements of my three favorite fast-play wargames, put them into a blender, and created this chimera. Intent is to use this for solo resolution of battles as part of a solo campaign, or as part of domain-level play in the background of another TTRPG such as D&D.

Wargames that I pillaged to create this include:

- Bob Cordery's [Portable Wargame](http://wargamingmiscellany.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html), in particular the [3x3 Fast Play variant](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1834456900102155/permalink/3099117333636099/) developed by Mark Cordone in 2022.
- [De Bellis Antiquitatis](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/299/de-bellis-antiquitatis-quick-play-wargame-rules-wi), particularly v3.0.
- [Dominion of the Spear](https://www.wargamevault.com/product/507147/Dominion-of-the-Spear) by Ork Publishing. 

Hence the name, "Dominium Expediti Antiquitatis", meaning "The Dominion of Portable Antiquity" (or thereabouts, according to Google Translate...). *DEA* for short?

From 3x3 Fast Play PW, I took the "loss on 1/2 units defeated" rule, and the idea for an "exhausted" state before a unit is defeated (basically a rewording of the common 2 SP compendium rule).

From DBA, I took the combat bonuses and tactical factors, the lack of HP or states that must be tracked (beyond my "exhausted" state which can be represented by flipping the token over to the other side), and the various unit types and their bonuses (Light Foot are Psioi, Heavy Foot are Spear/Blades, Light Horse are Light Horse, Heavy Horse are Knights). 

From Dominion of the Spear, I took the 2x3 board with reserve area. 

Intent is to use simple flat tokens of cardboard, chipboard, or MDF. Though I'm sure miniatures would work just as well.

### Setup

#### Battlefield

```
|	Reserve		|
| Left | Center | Right |
| Left | Center | Right |
|	Reserve		|
```

#### Terrain

Place terrain. Maybe I'll put a balanced tournament-style terrain drafting mechanic in here eventually, but for now it is narrative placement.  

- Hill: Only one per sector. Takes up 1/2 sector (only one side is on the hill).
- Rough Terrain: Takes up full sector. Woods, Marsh, BuA, etc.

#### Armies

Spend 24 points  on units per side. Each side must have at least 3 units.  
Place one unit in each sector, and the remainder in the reserve area.

**Light Foot**: +2, Skirmish, 4 points. This is intended to represent lightly armed and armored infantry fighting in open order such as peltasts, psiloi, Irish kern, and velites. Or alternatively, massed troops armed with ranged weapons such as longbowmen and crossbowmen.  
**Heavy Foot**: +4, Formation, 6 points. This is intended to represent any massed infantry of varying arms and armor fighting in close order. Men-at-arms, legionnaires, hoplites, gallowglass, halbardiers, huscarls, etc.  
**Light Horse**: +2, Mobile, 4 points. This is intended to represent steppe nomads and horse archers, or Roman auxilia cavalry.   
**Heavy Horse**: +4, Charge, 6 points. This intended to represent heavily armed and armored mounted troops, such as European knights or cataphracts.   

Finally, note your general's location. They can start in any sector or in the reserve area.

#### Unit Special Abilities

**Skirmish**: Ignore rough terrain combat penalty.  
**Charge**: Get +2 in open terrain.  
**Formation**: Get +1 for each flanking friendly unit with Formation.  
**Mobile**: May redeploy to any other sector after combat is resolved. The sector they vacate may then have a unit from the reserve area deployed to it (per normal rules).  

### Sequence of Play

1. Resolve combat from left to right.
2. Each side in a sector rolls a d6 and adds any bonuses from unit type or tactical factors:
    - Unit gets +1 if the general is in the sector  
    - Unit gets +1 if on top of a hill  
    - Unit gets -1 if flanked (count as flanked if one flank is not occupied by a friendly unit)  
    - Unit gets -1 if exhausted  
    - Unit gets -2 if in rough terrain  
3. Compare scores. Highest wins. No effect on ties. The loser is exhausted (flip token over). 
4. If the winner's score was double or greater than the loser's score ("doubled"), the loser is destroyed outright. Destroyed units are removed from the field.
5. If a unit would be exhausted again while it is already exhausted, it is destroyed instead.
6. If any sectors are empty after resolving combat, that side may deploy a unit from its reserves into each empty sector. Once deployed, a unit cannot be recalled or deployed to a different sector.
7. Game ends when 1/2 of a side's units are destroyed.

### Appendix

#### Advanced Units

**Civilians**: +0, 1 point   
**Levy**: +1, 2 points  
**Militia**: +2, 3 points  
**Warband**: +2, Charge, 4 points   
**Auxilia**: +2, Formation, 4 points   
**Rangers**: +4, Skirmish, 6 points   
**Warg Riders**: +4, Mobile, 6 points   

#### Custom Units

Start with 1 point   
+1 = 1 point   
Ability = 1 point   
Cannot have both Skirmish and Formation.
