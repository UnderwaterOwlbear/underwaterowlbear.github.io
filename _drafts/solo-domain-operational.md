## Population & Demography

Densities:

- Sparse = 1d6 people / sqmi
- Borderland = 2d6 people / sqmi
- Heartland = 3d6 people / sqmi

Military recruitment:

- 1 infantry per 20 people (5%)
- 1 knight or man-at-arms per 200 people (0.5%)
- nomadic pastoralists can muster 1 light horse archer per 10 people (10%). but these societies only sustain spare population densities (1d6 people per sqmi).

Mark a grid square as "mustered" once soldiers are recruited from it. Squares that have already been mustered cannot be mustered a second time. Once the regiment mustered from it is disbanded and the people return, clear the "mustered" status.

Cities:

for every 100 rural farmers, have 5 city folk (~5% urbanization rate). 

the largest cities are typically around 10,000 people. this means a large city is supported by 200,000 farmers. with a typical population density of 10 people / sqmi, this city requires 20,000 sqmi of farmland (or 200 squares)

cities require 100 sqmi or farmland (1 grid square) per 50 people living in it (20 squares per 1,000 people).

## Mapping & Travel

square grid of 10mi per side. 100 sqmi. diagonal distance of 15 mi.

Travel speeds

army or wagon train = 1d6+8 miles per day (9-14 mi/day)
individual = 2d6+8 mi/day (10-20 mi/day)
mounted = 3d6+8 mi/day (11-26 mi/day)

## Food & Forage

1 bushel of grain feeds 1 person for 1 month and weighs 50 lb.

thus, an army needs 250 bushels per week per 1,000 soldiers.

an army can carry 1 week of food on its backs, and an additional week if it carries a wagon train. harsh environments such as deserts deplete supplies at double the rate since water must be carried as well as food.

an army disbands after 2 weeks without food.

assume peasant farmers are subsistence farmers and retain barely enough grain to last the year (12 bushels per person). approximately 1/12 (8%) of this is able to be foraged by an invading army before the peasants flee or hide the rest. thus, a given grid square contains 1 bushel of available forage per 1 person living in it. in the fall and winter, this halves to 1 bushel per 2 people.

a foraged square restocks its food each year with the fall harvest.

## Time & Calendars

12 months of 4 weeks each

7 days per week, 28 per month, 336 days per year.

same as Earth.

## Money & Economics

1 pound sterling (L) = 240 silver pennies (d)

average peasant household earns ~1 L per year. this means approximately 240 d / yr or 20 d / month.

if a peasant household contains 5 people, and thus produces 5 bushels of grain per month, a bushel of grain will cost (in non-famine years), approximately 4 d. famines can increase this by up to 10x.

since 1 bushel feeds 1 person for 1 month (4 weeks), and costs 4 d, 1 week of food costs 1 d.

10% of this is taxed to the state and 10% to the church (24 d / yr or 2 d / mo each). useful for domain level income. note that this is mostly in-kind (grain or household goods).

other goods priced as:

- common = 1d6 x 1 d
    - simple food, tools, clothes
- uncommon = 1d6 x 10 d
    - nicer tools, fine food and wine, basic arms and armor (shield and helm, spear, axe, knife), livestock
- rare = 1d6 x 100 d
    - warhorse, sword, chainmail, plate armor, jewelry

Hirelings:

| Hireling | Wage (d / wk) |
|----------|---------------|
| laborer  | 1             |
| scout    | 1d6           |
| infantry | 1d6           |
| cavalry  | 1d6 x 10      |
| blacksmith  | 1d6 x 10      |
| sailor   | 1d6 x 10      |
| ship's captain | 1d6 x 100 |
| engineer | 1d6 x 100     |
