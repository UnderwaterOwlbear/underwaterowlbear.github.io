What if we made *Cairn* even simpler?

- Eliminate STR, DEX, WIS. Only HP, AC, MV
- HP 0 = death saves. give extra hp to compensate.
- Have single saving throw for death saves, etc
- Have MV / move / speed score for initiative, moves, fleeing, etc
- Spellcasting is either vancian or cast from hp

| Armor | DR | MV |
|-------|----|----|
| None  | 0  | 12 |
| Light | 1  | 9  |
| Heavy | 2  | 6  |

Roll under MV to act before monsters, flee, etc.

**Character Creation**: You have 6 hit points (HP), 3d6x10 silver pieces (SP), and a saving throw (ST) of 11.

**Experience & Advancement**: Gain 1 experience point (XP) for every SP spent on carousing, partying, donating, gambling, or other pursuits without material reward. When you gain a level, increase your ST by +1 (to a max of 19).

| Level | XP      |
|-------|--------:|
| 1     | 0       |
| 2     | 2,000   |
| 3     | 4,000   |
| 4     | 8,000   |
| 5     | 16,000  |
