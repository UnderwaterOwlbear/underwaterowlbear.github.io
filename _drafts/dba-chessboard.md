An attempt to play a simplified version of DBA 3.0 on a chessboard (or other gridded surface).

## Design Notes

I like domain level play. Waging war can be an important part of domain play. To facilitate this in as low-friction a way as possible, simplified wargame rules can be used. DBA is a game that I feel is historically rigorous, but still attempts to simplify gameplay to play faster than other historical wargames. I particularly like its combat resolution method - it completely lacks hit points, morale, conditions, or other ancilaary metrics that have to be tracked during play. This makes it attractive to me as a basis for a wargame that can quickly resolve domain-level battles inside of a session of another TTRPG.

A typical DBA playing area is 15 to 20 base widths (BW) to a side. Command distances are 8 BW with LoS, 4 BW without. Movements vary between 1 and 5 BW depending on troop type and terrain. I have attempted to retain these general proportions: command range is ~1/2 the playing field, and movement distances are 1/8 to 1/4 of the playing field per activation.

I have discarded the following features in an attempt to drastically lower the simplicity:

- Specialty units (scythed chariots, elephants, camelry).
- Some of he variations of foot units have been discarded or combined (psiloi and auxilia rolled into one "skirmishers", pikes discarded, etc).
- I have removed shooting and bow units from the game. With the "chunkier" square measurments, bow engagement range is no longer meaningfully different than close combat. This simplified many special cases in the rules.
- Cities have been removed. This is intended to be played in a medieval / dark ages context where villages, manors, and castles are more common than cities. 

I recognize that this drastically reduces the complexity and tactical variation that can be displayed in the game. I have deemed this an acceptable tradeoff for my use case.

## The Rules

**Playing Area**: An 8x8 gridded area, such as a chessboard.  
**Army Size and Troop Representation**: Army sizes are 8 units per side, 1 of which includes the general. Each army must have a camp. The camp must be occupied either by one of the 12 units, or by camp followers.   

### Troop Types - Foot

**Skirmishers (SK)**: Representing skirmishers and missile troops who are lightly armed and armored and who fight in loose formations.  
**Spearmen (SP)**: Represensenting troops armed with spears and shields who fight in close formation.  
**Blades (BL)**: Representing troops in heavy armor and armed with bladed weapons, who fight in close formation.  
**Warband (WB)**: Representing poorly trained but highly motivated or frevent troops, such as bersekers or raiders.

### Troop Types - Mounted

**Horse Archers (HA)**: Representing mounted warriors armed with missile weapons who harrass enemy formations.  
**Cavalry (CV)**: Representing medium armed and armored mounting units that can harrass or charge light foot units.  
**Knights (KN)**: Representing heavily armed and armored cavalry who employ shock charges against enemy formations.  

## Battlefield Terrain

Place 1-2 mandatory terrain features and 2-3 optional terrain features.

Mandatory:

* Rough going: Imposes movement penalty but no combat effects (rocky, scrubby, boggy ground, or enclosed fields with fences).
* Bad going: Breakes line-of-sight (LoS) and imposes movement penalty and combat effects (hills, woods, marsh, or gully).

Gullys are 1x4 squares, all others are 2x2 squares. Terrain elements must be placed 1 square away from each other and from the game board edge.

Optional:

* Waterway: Extends 2 squares inwards from battlefield edge and is impassible.
* River: Crosses the entire length of the board from edge to edge, is <1 square wide. See "Crossing a River" section below.
* Road: Crosses the entire length of the board from edge to edge, is <1 square wide.
* Fort: Occupied 1 square, provides defensive bonus to unit that garrisons it.

## Deployment

1. Attacker chooses base edge.
2. Defender chooses base edge.
3. Defender places camp.
4. Attacker places camp.
5. Defender deploys troops, 1 of which may be used to garrison a fort.
6. Attacked deploys troops.

Skirmishers and horse archers must deploy 1 square away from side edges. All other units must deploy 2 squares away from side edges.

## Sequence of Play

Defender takes first turn, then alternating. During a turn:

1. Dice for command points.
2. Use command points to move units.
3. Units in contact resolve close combat. Active player chooses resolution order.

## Movement

Spend command points to move.

| Command points | Situation                                    |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1              | First move entirely along road               |
| 0              | Subsequent moves entirely along road         |
| 1              | Unit not on road                             |

| Modifier       | Situation                                    |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| +1             | Move out of garrison                         |
| +1             | Camp followers                               |
| +1             | General in bad going                         |
| +1             | More than command distance away from general |

Command distance per following:

- Unlimited for horse archers
- 4 squares for units in LoS to general
- 2 square for units not in LoS to general

Move distances:

| Unit          | Open Terrain | Rough or Bad Going |
|---------------|--------------|--------------------|
| Skirmishers   | 2            | 2                  |
| Spearmen      | 1            | 1                  |
| Blades        | 1            | 1                  |
| Warband       | 1            | 1                  |
| Horse Archers | 2            | 1                  |
| Cavalry       | 2            | 1                  |
| Knights       | 2            | 1                  |

Multiple moves: Most units can only move once per turn. The following units are exceptions and can move multiple times (if you have the command points to do so):

- Along a road: unlimited moves
- Horse archers: 3 moves max
