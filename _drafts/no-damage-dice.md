## Combat Rules

Armor provides an Armor Class (AC) depending on type.

- Unarmored = AC 10
- Padded = AC 12
- Maille = AC 14
- Plate = AC 16
- Shield = +1 AC
    - Shields may be sundered to ignore all damage from a hit.
- Helm = +1 AC
    - Helms may be sundered to ignore all damage from a critical hit.

Attacks are made be rolling d20 + HD. Results equal to or greater than AC are hits. Results equal to or greater than a weapon's critical hit threshold are critical hits. Critical hits always hit, and deal additional damage.

Normal hits deal 1 damage to the target. Fighters deal 3 damage on a critical hit. Other classes deal 2 damage on a critical hit. Thieves automatically crit when they succeed on a sneak attack.

If a critical hit kills a target with damage still left over, excess damage can be applied to another nearby target with equal to or lesser AC.
